# Responsive Design

<span class="lead"> </span>

Responsive design covers topics that range from fixed layouts to fully responsive websites. Responsive design addresses accessibility challenges and how developers can use flexible units to overcome them. On top of being accessible, fully responsive websites are a joy to use and push web development forward into the future.

**At the end of this module, you should be able to:**

-   describe the differences in fixed, fluid, adaptive, and responsive layouts
-   demonstrate knowledge of media queries by correctly implementing them in a project
-   describe how using scalable units for font sizes impacts accessibility and why designing accessible web pages is important

#### Pro Tip

No problem can withstand the assault of sustained thinking.

#### Learn to describe the differences in fixed, fluid, adaptive, and responsive layouts

Responsive web design is focused on providing the best user experience possible for the growing number of devices across the world today. Knowing how to build responsive layouts is a must have skill for any developer looking to get into a front end or user interface role.

##### Overview

### Responsive Web Design Layouts

Knowing the subtle nuances between responsive web design layouts will allow you to make better technical decisions for your apps and websites. Let’s take a look at some design terms and how they translate into code.

#### Fixed Layout

Fixed layouts are what the early web looked like. Designs usually looked good on desktop screens but would slowly get worse as the browser’s viewport got smaller. Horizontal scroll bars were a normal feature and you would find yourself pinching and zooming all over mobile devices to read a website.

The user experience on multiple devices is usually poor, so why are fixed designs still around today? Because fixed layouts are much cheaper to build and maintain.

##### Features of Fixed Layout

-   Design is usually desktop only.
-   CSS widths are usually hardcoded pixels.
-   Horizontal scroll bars appear as the viewport shrinks smaller than the website’s design.
-   No media queries are used.
-   Quicker deployment.

#### Fluid Layout

The opposite of a fixed layout is one that could expand and contract in proportion to most devices. This sounds great at first, but without constraints, you soon have to think about how your site will look on several devices with one set of styles.

Some of the problems of a fluid layout include: images getting too small, buttons growing too large, and layouts that can grow to be way too spacious on large desktops. It’s a constant game of white space and content. Fluid layouts still have a place in modern web design but are seen less frequently compared to adaptive and responsive.

##### Features of Fluid Layout

-   Design is often divided among desktop, tablet, or phone
-   Percent based units instead of hard coded pixels
-   Everything is designed to proportionally shrink
-   No media queries are used

#### Adaptive Layout

Adaptive layouts borrow from the speed of a fixed-layout but accommodate different devices at specific breakpoints in design. For example, an adaptive website may have hardcoded pixels used for layout using media queries for different devices.

Adaptive layout is another cheap and easy way to get more content out quickly for a business to more devices. Adaptive layout still lacks in accommodating for thousands of devices because care was only given to specific designs at certain breakpoints. It’s a lot better than fixed, but we can do more with a responsive layout.

##### Features of Adaptive Layout

-   Design is often divided among desktop, tablet, or phone
-   Media queries are used
-   Layout widths are still hardcoded at each media query
-   Quick deployment for specific devices

#### Responsive Layout

Responsive layouts combine features of fixed, adaptive, and fluid websites into one seamless experience. Media queries are used to constrain responsive units so that as the viewport expands or shrinks, you get an experience that looks and functions beautifully across thousands of devices and screen sizes.

Responsive sites take more time and effort to create and are the standard long term projects should aim for.

##### Features of Responsive Layout

-   Design is often divided among desktop, tablet, or phone.
-   Responsive units are used throughout the site.
-   Media queries are used.
-   Site accommodates thousands of devices and takes longer to build.

##### Follow Along

### Responsive Web Design Layout Tutorial

Let’s use the same HTML structure to showcase the differences between fixed, fluid, adaptive, and responsive layouts. You can use your own editor to follow along or just [click this link](https://codepen.io/lambdaschool/pen/gZwPVg?editors=1100) to see the codepen version

We will use this HTML:

    <div class="container">
      <header>
        <nav>
          <a href="#">Home</a>
          <a href="#">About</a>
          <a href="#">Blog</a>
          <a href="#">Contact</a>
        </nav>
      </header>
      <section class="main-content">
        <h1>Layouts</h1>
        <p>Testing out different layouts!</p>
      </section>
    </div>

### Fixed CSS

Given the HTML above, let’s use the following CSS to provide some constraints and a border so we can see our `.container`.

    /* Fixed Layout */
    .container {
      width: 800px;
      padding: 20px;
      border: 1px solid red;
      margin: 0 auto;
    }

Notice the `width` and `padding` values are hardcoded pixels. Try resizing your browser and see where the horizontal scroll bars show up.

This layout makes for really poor user experience if you’re on a small screen or any kind of device that doesn’t match the 800px width.

### Fluid CSS

Fluid utilizes the `%` responsive unit to control layout. Notice that we have to be careful about the total width of the container adding up to 100%. We have to be careful to update both the width and padding to equal 100% or we will see horizontal scroll bars again as the viewport shrinks.

Comment out the fixed CSS code from above and use our new fluid code.

    /* Fluid Layout */
    .container {
      width: 98%;
      margin: 0 auto;
      border: 1px solid red;
      padding: 20px 1%;
    }

Notice how small and how large you can resize the window without hurting the integrity of the web page. This simple example showcases the major visual difference between fixed and fluid. Let’s take a look at how adaptive can use media queries to control layout on a specific device.

### Adaptive CSS

With adaptive layout, we are going to take the fixed layout code and apply media queries to it.

Comment out the fluid CSS code from above and use our new adaptive code.

    /* Adaptive Layout */
    .container {
      width: 800px;
      margin: 0 auto;
      border: 1px solid red;
      padding: 20px;
    }

    @media(max-width: 500px) {
      .container {
        width: 500px;
        background: gray;
      }

      .container header nav {
        display: flex;
        flex-direction: column;
      }

      .container header nav a {
        margin-bottom: 20px;
      }
    }

Notice how we added some more styles specifically for our mobile view? This process is part of how adaptive “adapts” to the viewport. The problem with this solution is it’s still too rigid.

### Responsive CSS

Responsive uses constraints with `%` based layouts for that seamless feeling between devices. For example, we can use a css property of `max-width` to control the maximum width of a container while also providing `%` flexibility below it. Notice how we changed `.container` to now stop growing past `800px`. Also, note that any horizontal margin or padding was converted into a responsive unit.

These subtle changes will continue to be discussed later in this unit but for now, study the code and notice it’s not that big of a difference when we compare our adaptive layout.

    /* Responsive */
    .container {
      max-width: 800px;
      margin: 0 auto;
      border: 1px solid red;
      padding: 20px 1.25%;
    }

    @media(max-width: 500px) {
      .container {
        background: gray;
      }

      .container header nav {
        display: flex;
        flex-direction: column;
      }

      .container header nav a {
        margin-bottom: 20px;
      }
    }

##### Challenge

### Responsive Web Design Layout Challenge

Go to some of your favorite websites and use your browser’s developer tools to inspect their layouts.

Study the HTML and CSS and see how they made their site responsive. You may find responsive units you have never seen before!

Take note of things you found that were interesting or confusing. Bring those questions or observations to your group and discuss them in standup.

#### Learn to demonstrate knowledge of media queries by correctly implementing them in a project

Media queries are an amazing tool for developers to build many types of responsive websites. Having a grasp of how they work and what you can do with them increases your ability to code for thousands of devices.

##### Overview

Max-width and min-width are the keys to the car when it comes to media queries. Understanding that “mobile first design” directly translates into min-width is a concept that many new developers struggle with.

This simple example demonstrates the differences in max and min-width:

https://codepen.io/bigknell/pen/ddYKVq

Media queries use max and min width to determine where breakpoints are introduced so it’s a big deal to make sure we understand how each works concerning the viewport.

##### Follow Along

Let’s put media queries to work by working on a desktop-down approach.  
  

Go to this codepen: https://codepen.io/bigknell/pen/GQjGgr?editors=1100  
  
Base colors:  
box1: aqua  
box2: azure  
box3: cadetblue  
  
At 1000px and below:  

-   Change the width to 80% for ALL boxes  
-   box1: blue  
-   box2: green  
-   box3: red  
      
    At 768px and below:  
-   Change the width to 60% for ALL boxes  
-   box1: teal  
-   box2: gold  
-   box3: pink  
      
    At 400px and below:  
-   Change the width to 60% for ALL boxes  
-   box1: purple  
-   box2: black  
-   box3: gray  

##### Challenge

Keep the color and width requirements we just did as a group, but take a mobile first approach by using min-width.

That means the base colors of: box1: aqua box2: azure box3: cadetblue

Need to show up AFTER 1000px and up. This also means the boxes should go back to 100px at 1000px and up as well.

This is a solo challenge, please don’t share code until the solution is presented!

#### Learn to describe how using scalable units for font sizes impacts accessibility and why designing accessible web pages is important

##### Overview

### What is Accessibility?

Web accessibility, as you might expect, deals with making web pages and the internet accessible to all people, regardless of how they need to interact with the page. As web developers you should be designing web pages with *all* people in mind. Including, but not limited to: those with slow internet connection, those on mobile devices, those with auditory, cognitive, neurological, or physical disabilities,and those with visual needs. Recent studies show that up to 2.5% of all internet users interact with the web using a screen reader, which is a considerable number of people.

### Universal Design Theory

[Universal design theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_design) states that designing with the “furthest out” individual in mind will end up benefiting all individuals who use the product or environment. This theory reaches all sorts of design—web, architecture, learning, and more. A commonly used example of universal design theory, applied to a real-world problem, are ramps on sidewalks. Though they were originally designed for people who need wheelchairs, they are used and enjoyed by many others for different needs such as parents with children in strollers.

The idea of accessibility in web originated because people with disabilities needed to be able to access the internet in non-traditional ways. Unsurprisingly though, designing accessible websites has compounding benefits and it helps a plethora of other people. For example, folks using smaller browser screens are positively impacted by websites designed for those who need larger font sizes.

Other universal benefits of accessibility include designs intended for permanent physical impairments that help people with temporary issues (like a broken thumb) and designs intended for the hearing impaired, for example closed captioning, that help everyone when they’re in a loud space or can’t use headphones.

### Responsive Units

One of the simplest ways to make sure your website is accessible is to use responsive units. We touched on these already, but scalable units are really important in terms of accessibility. For example, browsers have settings that allow users to change a page’s font size, but that only works if the associated CSS is scalable—REM, EM, % are all scalable.

A well implemented example of this is the [whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) webpage—go ahead and play around with your browser font size, and try zooming in and out to see what this looks like.

This same logic applies to images and buttons, or really anything and everything that you might style on your page.

### Screen Readers

Screen readers are a great thing to keep top of mind while designing for accessibility. A screen reader is a tool (a browser extension or app) that transmits web page data for people with visual impairments, learning disabilities, or other needs; They usually operate by verbalizing the content or sometimes translating into braille. Screen readers read content based on how the HTML is coded, starting with `<h1>` headings, and navigating through other elements accordingly.

As a web developer, it is important to make sure that your tags are *semantic* so that users who rely on screen readers can navigate accordingly. A webpage made entirely with `<div>` for example, would provide no hierarchy to the screen reader or the user, and would prevent them from being able to navigate the site.

Semantic tags typically have english meaning, like `<header>`, `<main>`, `<nav>`, `<button>` and `<article>`. Non-semantic tags are those without any english meaning, like `<div>` and `<span>`.

Similarly, when designing universally, you should be sure to include meaningful id and class names, and always give your images “alt” text.

### Color

Close to 5% of the population of the United States (about 3 million people) is colorblind. Not to mention that plenty of folks view websites in grey scale out of personal preference. Therefore, when color is used to convey an important message, the message can be lost on a lot of users.

To avoid this issue, every colorfully displayed component should have a visual counterpart. A common example of this difference is pictured below. Here, there is a form field showing an error message. The top example isn’t accessible but the bottom is, simply because we added a symbol.

![Form Accessibility](https://tk-assets.lambdaschool.com/96fabbf6-aadc-4b38-8a85-a7b2bac6be3f_Slice.png)

In addition, you’ll want to use colors that contrast well, and try to avoid red and green in general, since they are the trickiest colors for people who are colorblind.

### Final Thoughts

There are entire careers dedicated to making webpages accessible, and this is just the tip of the iceberg. When it comes to designing for accessibility, it isn’t just the right thing to do, in many cases, [it’s also the law](https://www.section508.gov/manage/laws-and-policies). We hope this introduction encourages you to employ universal design theory from here on out!

##### Follow Along

Study the code below – What’s accessible? What’s not? Together, we’ll change the code to make it more accessible.

See the Pen [Accessibility](https://codepen.io/lambdaschool/pen/bGdJEQO) by Lambda School ([@lambdaschool](https://codepen.io/lambdaschool)) on [CodePen](https://codepen.io).

One of the first things you should notice above is that every element uses a `<div>` tag. If a screen reader were trying to read this code, it would start with “This is some text that isn’t as important,” instead of the title.

We can easily change all of the divs to h1, h2, and p tags, to make it compatible with screen readers. That might look like this:

    <h2 class="something">This is some text that isn't as important </h2>
    <h1 class="title">This is a title</h1>
    <p class="red">This is an important message!</p>
    <p class="green">This is an important message!</p>

Instantly more accessible! Another big no-no in this pen is the hard-coded pixels. Those should be changed to responsive units. You can use the information below or use this super helpful w3 schools [cheat sheet](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_pxtoemconversion.asp) to convert pixels to `%`.

    html{
      text-align: center;
      margin: 3%;
    }
    .title {
      color: blue;
      font-size:120%;
    }

    .something{
      font-size: 56.25%;
    }

Finally, let’s look at the `class` names. Since there is so little content on this site, it doesn’t seem like that matters, but consider what would happen if we started to add styling, or build out whole classes. Before moving on, change the class “something” to “subtitle”. This helps not only screen readers, but your future developer self.

    <h2 class="subtitle">This is some text that isn't as important </h2>

    ### Responsive Web Design Layout Challenge

    Go to some of your favorite websites and use your browser’s developer tools to inspect their layouts.

    Study the HTML and CSS and see how they made their site responsive. You may find responsive units you have never seen before!

    Take note of things you found that were interesting or confusing. Bring those questions or observations to your group and discuss them in standup.

-   Objective challenge:

    Keep the color and width requirements we just did as a group, but take a mobile first approach by using min-width.

    That means the base colors of: box1: aqua box2: azure box3: cadetblue

    Need to show up AFTER 1000px and up. This also means the boxes should go back to 100px at 1000px and up as well.

    This is a solo challenge, please don’t share code until the solution is presented!
