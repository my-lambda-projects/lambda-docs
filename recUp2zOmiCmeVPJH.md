# Sprint 2 - Demonstrating Contribution

<span class="lead"> </span>

Check out the guided projects, module inquiries, and sprint challenge for your second sprint in labs.

## [Guided Project: Pair Programming](../module/recDE1yLi7fBNUfIu)

## Objectives

- Student can articulate the challenges and lessons learned from managing their time working on a complex project in a team.

## Resources

- 🐙 [Training Kit GitHub Repo](https://github.com/LambdaSchool/labs-curriculum)
- 🐙 [Labs Student Guide](https://www.notion.so/lambdaschool/Labs-25-Student-Guide-7be23f8048ca4d2eae69a06f4613f67a)

## Schedule

Here’s an overview of our guided project schedule today.

![Pair Programming GP Schedule](https://tk-assets.lambdaschool.com/7befa33a-e3cf-476e-bfb5-d3a09e41c432_ScreenShot2020-08-04at5.41.21PM.png)

## Purpose

Pair programming involves two programmers working together at one station: the driver writes code while the other, an observer/navigator, reviews the code as it’s written. The driver and navigator switch roles frequently.

In addition to reviewing the code as it’s written, the navigator also considers the strategic direction of the work, coming up with ideas for improvement and anticipating potential future problems. The objective of pair programming is to free the driver to focus their attention solely on completing the task itself, relying on the navigator as a safety net and guide.

## Lesson

### _I Do_

#### What is pair programming?

- Your instructor walks through the definition, roles, and objectives of pair programming.

### _We Do_

#### Live pair programming

- Two engineering managers demonstrate a pair programming session for the class. One acts as driver and the other as navigator.

#### Pair programming feedback

- Your instructor directs you to breakout rooms and where you compare notes on the pair programming session you observed – what seemed to work well and where you noticed opportunity for improvement.

#### Reviewing feedback

- Your instructors conduct a live review of student feedback on their pairing session and discuss strengths and weaknesses.

#### Instructor/student pairing session

- Your instructor invites a student volunteer to replace an engineering manager in the role of navigator. The student and instructor demonstrate another pairing session for the class (with the instructor driving). They create a pull request together.

### _You Do_

#### Instructor/student feedback

- Your instructor offers feedback on the pair programming session and directs students to schedule a pairing session with another student.

---

## After Class

Take a few minutes to review the principles you’ve learned. What questions do you still have? Remember, your instructor, TL, and Labs Support Hours are here to help. Don’t hesitate to reach out.

#### Objectives:

## [Module Inquiry 3](../module/recFTj2n2I2J6V47t)

## Questions

1.  What feature did you work on with a teammate up to this point in the sprint?
2.  When were you the driver? When were you the navigator? Which role did you prefer and why?
3.  What was difficult about being a navigator?
4.  How will you adjust your pair programming behavior in the future?

#### Objectives:

## [Guided Project: Discussing Your Work](../module/recEBojAtFGOgbuz6)

## Objectives

- Student can articulate their delivery process in contributing to and completing individual tasks.
- Student can demonstrate, in detail, how their solution relates to the specification and architectural standards.

## Schedule

Here’s an overview of our guided project schedule today.

![Discussing Your Work GP schedule](https://tk-assets.lambdaschool.com/3dc7f98f-7768-48dc-aa72-9f2a81cf8d2b_ScreenShot2020-08-04at5.47.27PM.png)

## Purpose

From a hiring manager perspective, the ability to discuss the reasoning and technical decision-making behind the work is just as important as the work itself.

Taking time to consider and practice responding to likely hiring manager questions is just as vital as the time spent assembling a portfolio.

## Lesson

### _I Do_

#### Talking about what you built

- Your Careers Specialist discusses what hiring managers are looking for when they ask candidates to talk about what they built.

### _We Do_

#### Hiring manager questions

- Your Careers Specialist guides class participation via Slack in assembling a number of questions hiring managers could ask about your individual contribution.

#### Mock interview

- Your Careers Specialist interviews the Engineering Manager about a feature they built:
  - “Tell me about a project you worked on”
  - “What did you specifically build on the project?”
  - “Can you show me what you built?”
- During the interview, the Engineering Manager walks through a pull request and live demo of what they built.

#### Breakout room write-up

- In breakout rooms, in groups of four, you’re given a set of interview questions. One student in the group pulls up their work and everyone writes answers to the following questions about that work:
  - “Tell me about a project you worked on?”
  - “What specifically did you build on the project?”
  - “Can you show me what you built?”
- For the last question, students should link screenshots and code snippets.

### _You Do_

#### Student interview

- Your Career Specialist and Engineering Manager conduct a live interview with a student volunteer and provide feedback. You’ll then be directed to use what you’ve learned to level up your careers artifacts.

---

## After Class

Take a few minutes to review the principles you’ve learned. What questions do you still have? Remember, your instructor, TL, and Labs Support Hours are here to help. Don’t hesitate to reach out.

#### Objectives:

## [Module Inquiry 4](../module/rec0ONoNSxKc44E6n)

## Questions

1.  Link to the pull request you are most proud of.
2.  Why are you proud of this feature? What was difficult about its implementation?
3.  How does this feature help the user?
4.  Think about the process of delivering this feature: from ideation, to scoping, to pairing, to testing. Knowing what you know now, what would you change about the way in which you delivered this feature?

#### Objectives:

## [Sprint Challenge](../module/rechUVGd9i8UhcK3Q)

## Objectives

- Student can articulate their delivery process in contributing to and completing individual tasks.
- Student can demonstrate, in detail, how their solution relates to the specification and architectural standards.
- Student can articulate the challenges and lessons learned from managing their time working on a complex project in a team.

## Prompt 1 - Communicating Individual Contribution

On the job, you will be responsible for shipping features regularly. Engineers are given tickets and are expected to deliver them. Hiring managers want to see that you are capable of delivering a feature.

Here are some examples of hiring manager interview questions:

- “Tell me about a project you’ve built.”
- “What were some technical challenges on that project? How did you overcome them?”

We took these questions and cooked them into your labs experience. This week, you should have shipped at least one feature. Answer the following questions like you would in an interview:

1.  Describe what you built this week. Link any relevant pull requests or paste screenshots of code.
2.  How does what you built contribute to the overall product your team is building? What user problems does it help solve?
3.  Describe your delivery process for what you built this week from ideation to breakdown to implementation. What challenges occurred during the delivery process that you didn’t foresee?

## Prompt 2 - Communicating Teamwork

As a software developer, you will almost always be on a team. As a result, engineering hiring managers want to see how you work on a team. As a junior developer, you will often pair with seniors on features. Here are some examples of interview questions you may get asked concerning teamwork:

- “Tell me about a time you worked on a team. What was hard about it?”
- “What is your greatest weakness as a team player? How have you improved?”

This week we taught you how to pair with other team members. You should have worked with at least one other person to deliver a feature. Reflect on that experience and answer the following questions like you would in an interview:

1.  How did you work with another team member to deliver a feature this week? What role did you play?
2.  What did you learn this week from working in a team? How are you going to improve your teamwork in the future?

## Prompt 3 - Professional Development Resume Updates

This week you gained more clarity surrounding your individual contributions and what is happening with your project. Use this clarification, along with your understanding of power statements, to update the projects sections of your resume. When adding a project to your resume, you should include power statement bullets describing the project as if it were a job! Without these bullets you’re simply sharing the name of a project (and maybe a tech stack) with little to no clarity on what you did on that project.

To ensure you are creating a robust and ready to use job search resume, use this [resume checklist](https://www.notion.so/lambdaschool/Resume-30f5e6add3324891823192487798cb6d) as a way to organize and add content. If you skipped the resume lesson earlier in the curriculum and are starting from scratch, you’ll want to review [this assignment worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yAvlgwSPTdXxAbtx3mgfWp6dkNnqtzGGLlRy2yQ7fiA/edit) to establish a resume draft (though the resume checklist will help you establish a draft as well).

### To complete the career portion of this challenge:

1.  Updated your resume to include your labs project, with power statements articulating your individual tasks.

2.  Upload this resume version to CV compiler for feedback:

    1️⃣ Go to the website <https://cvcompiler.com/students/lambda>

    2️⃣ Log in (using LinkedIn or GitHub) -> Fill out the form

    3️⃣ Enter the special promo code \[LSalumni, ANDresumes, iOSresumes, DSresumes, WEBresumes, UXresumes\] during checkout

    4️⃣ Upload your resume and start working on improving it with CV Compiler

3.  After making the recommended CV Compiler edits, submit a final resume draft to your TL.

4.  Update your LinkedIn to include any new content you made for your resume. The experience bullets you created for your resume and projects are great examples of content you should consider bringing over to your profile.
