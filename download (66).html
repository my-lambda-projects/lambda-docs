                  Many times, both as you are working through the Computer
                  Science curriculum and when you are on the job, you will find
                  yourself faced with large, challenging problems. There are
                  strategies we can use to break these problems down into more
                  manageable pieces.

                    âThe single most important skill for a computer scientist is
                    problem-solving. Problem-solving means the ability to
                    formulate problems, think creatively about solutions, and
                    express a solution clearly and accurately. As it turns out,
                    the process of learning to program is an excellent
                    opportunity to practice problem-solving skills.â Think

                  Every problem, large or small, can be broken into smaller
                  chunks. Logically, if you can take a seemingly unsolvable
                  problem and break it into smaller, more manageable chunks,
                  once youâve finished solving each piece of the problem, youâll
                  have conquered the whole thing!

                  Throughout the Computer Science curriculum, we will reference
                  and draw from the Lambda Problem Solving Framework, sometimes
                  referred to as <strong>UPER</strong>. This framework is a
                  step-by-step process:
                </p>
                <ol>
                  <li><strong>U</strong>nderstand</li>
                  <li><strong>P</strong>lan</li>
                  <li><strong>E</strong>xecute</li>
                  <li><strong>R</strong>eflect</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                  Almost all problems are a series of sub-problems. You will use
                  the steps of <strong>U.P.E.R</strong> on the primary outer
                  problem and the inner, individual sub-problems.

                  Before doing anything else, make sure you understand precisely
                  what the problem is asking. A helpful starting point could be
                  transcribing the technical description of the problem into
                  your own words.

                <p>
                  Here is a list of starter questions that might come up during
                  this step:

                    <em>What are the inputs your code receives?</em>

                      <li><em>What is the range of the input?</em></li>
                      <li>
                        <em>How big can the input be (how much data)?</em>
                      </li>
                    </ul>

                        <em>How big can the output be (how much data)?</em>
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li><em>How performant must the code be?</em></li>
                  <li>
                    <em

                      needs to be clarified?</em
                    >
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <em>What assumptions are you making?</em>

                        <em
                          >Does anyone else on the team need to validate these
                          assumptions?</em

                      </li>
                    </ul>

                <p>
                  The most important thing you can <strong>do</strong> during
                  this stage of the process is to
                  <strong>ask questions</strong>! Be as specific as you can when
                  you ask questions. Be clear and concise with your questions by
                  using unambiguous language and only including necessary
                  details.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Donât be afraid of this part of the processâenjoy it! Look at
                  the problem as a curiosity to be explored, not just something
                  there to torment you. Feeling frustrated and afraid wonât help
                  you at work or in an interview. Remember, problem-solving is
                  the fun part, so enjoy it!
                </p>
                <p>
                  One approach is to identify the smaller components that make
                  up the larger problem. If you get stuck in understanding,
                  break the larger problem into smaller sub-problems. Then,
                  apply this framework against each of the smaller sub-problems
                  until you solve the larger problem.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Try to digest the problem and comprehend it by rewriting the
                  problem in your own words. If you had to describe it to
                  someone else, how would you do it?
                </p>
                <p>
                  Diagram how the data flows through the problem. Think about
                  each stage of the journey for the data. What will happen to it
                  as it travels from one step to another?
                </p>
                <p>
                  Think like a villain. What inputs would break your program?
                </p>
                <p>
                  Where is the description of the problem incomplete? If you
                  cannot get answers on something that the specifications leave
                  unclear, make an educated guess, and document your assumptions
                  and decision.
                </p>
                <p>
                  You are done with this step when you can explain this problem
                  to someone who has never seen it. Your explanation should be
                  thorough enough for the person to skip the âUnderstandâ step
                  and start planning right away.
                </p>
                <h3 id="2-plan"><strong>2. Plan</strong></h3>
                <p>
                  This step is where you will ask, â<em
                    >what steps will I take to solve the problem</em
                  >?â You will take your description of the problem and
                  transform it into a complete, actionable plan to solve that
                  problem. If you realize you still donât truly understand the
                  problem while planning, return to
                  <strong>Understand</strong> until you resolve the ambiguity.
                  If you have not yet completed <strong>Understand</strong>, you
                  will end up planning to solve the wrong problem! When
                  interviewing, you must do this step aloud!
                </p>
                <p>
                  Remember, you arenât coding during this step unless itâs a
                  small piece of throwaway code to test a hypothesis. It would
                  be best if you wrote pseudocode during this step, however.

                  Solve the problem like a human. If youâre sorting something,
                  imagine your task as a pile of blocks that you need to sort by
                  hand. Break down the steps you take into small enough pieces
                  for a computer to understand. Approach the problem from many
                  angles.

                  Try to solve a simpler version of the problem. If the input is
                  a 2D array, can you solve it for a 1D array? If you need to
                  count the number of ways to eat cookies 1, 2, or 3 at a time,
                  first try to solve it for the number of ways you could eat two
                  at a time, or even one at a time. The solution to the more
                  straightforward problem can lead to insights on the more
                  complex problem.

                  List the nouns and verbs in the problem description. Map each

                  âPerfectâ can be the enemy of âgood.â Even if your initial
                  workable solution isnât performant enough, you can iterate
                  later. âPremature optimization is the root of all evil.â

                <p>
                  You know that you completed this step when you have pseudocode
                  thatâs detailed enough to convert to real code. It would be
                  best if you also were convinced the pseudocode represents a
                  legitimate working solution.

                  This step is where you take your plan and convert it to actual
                  working code. This step isnât easy, but itâs much easier if
                  youâve done an excellent job with the âUnderstandâ and âPlanâ
                  steps above. If you find shortcomings in your plan while
                  implementing the solution, return to the âPlanâ phase until
                  you resolve the ambiguity. If you have not yet completed the
                  âPlanâ step, you will spend far longer on the âExecuteâ step
                  than you have to.

                <p>
                  Adding documentation is a necessary action during this step.
                  It would be best if you documented any future changes you plan
                  on making. You should document any code sections that you will
                  need to make more performant if the data size increases.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Another critical action to take during this step is to remove
                  any redundant or unnecessary code. Also, depending on your
                  time constraints, itâs likely that you might have some hackish
                  code that youâd like to improve in the future when time
                  allows. Make sure to document any ideas or plans on how you
                  might do so.
                </p>
                <p>
                  You know that this step is complete when your code is
                  adequately refactored and exhaustively documented.

                  as an example problem to use our Problem Solving Framework on.
                  Hereâs a short description of the problem:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    Five silent philosophers sit at a round table with bowls of
                    noodles. One chopstick is placed between each pair of
                    adjacent philosophers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Each philosopher must alternately think and eat. However, a
                    philosopher can only eat noodles when they have both left
                    and right chopsticks. Each chopstick can be held by only one
                    philosopher and so a philosopher can use the chopstick only
                    if it is not being used by another philosopher. After an
                    individual philosopher finishes eating, they need to put
                    down both chopsticks so that the chopsticks become available
                    to others. A philosopher can take the chopstick on their
                    right or the one on their left as they become available, but
                    cannot start eating before getting both chopsticks.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Eating is not limited by the remaining amounts of noodles or
                    stomach space; an infinite supply and an infinite demand are
                    assumed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The problem is how to design a discipline of behavior (a
                    concurrent algorithm) such that no philosopher will starve;
                    i.e. each can forever continue to alternate between eating
                    and thinking, assuming that no philosopher can know when
                    others may want to eat or think.
                  </p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>
                  On the surface, this seems like a straightforward problem â
                  however, some approaches will lead to problematic results.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Here are some critical pieces of information from the question
                  we should highlight:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>there are <strong>5</strong> philosophers</li>
                  <li>
                    there are <strong>2 states</strong> (eating, thinking)
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    there is precisely 1 chopstick in between each pair of
                    philosophers (5 total)
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    BOTH chopsticks are required to transition from thinking to
                    eating
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  Some essential questions to ask here include
                  <em>âWhen should philosophers pick up a chopstick?â</em> and
                  <em>âWhen should philosophers put down a chopstick?â</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Remember that you want to establish if there are any
                  restrictions or limitations you need to consider before you
                  work on a solution.
                </p>
                <h3 id="2-plan"><strong>2. Plan</strong></h3>
                <p>
                  Letâs create a solution written as a set of rules that defines
                  how philosophers should interact with chopsticks in a manner
                  that will allow them to transition between <em>eating</em> and
                  <em>thinking</em>.
                </p>
                <ol>
                  <li>philosopher is eating (2 chopsticks)</li>
                  <li>philosopher finishes eating and sets down chopsticks</li>
                  <li>philosopher is thinking (0 chopsticks)</li>
                  <li>
                    philosopher sees his/her neighbor set down chopsticks &amp;
                    picks them up
                  </li>
                  <li>repeat steps 1-4</li>
                </ol>
                <h3 id="3-execute"><strong>3. Execute</strong></h3>
                <p>
                  We could break down the general plan above into a few specific
                  rules.
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    eat for a set amount of time once they are holding both
                    chopsticks
                  </li>
                  <li>put down the right chopstick</li>
                  <li>put down the left chopstick</li>
                  <li>
                    pick up the left chopstick as soon as it becomes available
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    pick up the right chopstick as soon as it becomes available
                  </li>
                  <li>repeat</li>
                </ul>
                <p>However, this solution will NOT always work.</p>
                <h3 id="4-reflect"><strong>4. Reflect</strong></h3>
                <p>
                  The above solution has the potential to create a situation
                  known in Computer Science as <strong>deadlock</strong>. A
                  deadlock means that two processes are stuck in an eternal
                  state of waiting. If neither has two chopsticks, they cannot
                  eat. But they also wonât put down chopsticks theyâre holding
                  (because they havenât eaten yet). We need to revise the rules
                  about when philosophers should pick up / put down chopsticks
                  to eliminate this possibility.
                </p>
                <h5>Challenge</h5>
                <p>
                  For everyone to eat, there are some situations in which
                  philosophers <em>should</em> pick up a chopstick and some
                  cases in which they <em>should NOT</em> (because another
                  philosopher needs to use it).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Write a better solution to the dining philosophers problem so
                  that deadlock does NOT occur.

                <h5>Overview</h5>
                <p>
                  The necessary action when asking a question is to imagine that
                  you are trying to answer your question. Because you are deep
                  in your problemâs weeds, itâs easy to forget that the person
                  who answers your question does not have all the context. We
                  should keep this general rule in mind â itâs the overarching
                  rule for all the details we go into next.
                </p>
                <h3 id="search-and-research">Search and Research</h3>
                <p>
                  Before you do anything else, search for a solution to your
                  problem on your own. One thing you should start doing is
                  keeping track of all your research when solving a problem. One
                  easy way to do this is to have a browser window represent a
                  specific search for a solution, and each open tab represents
                  an attempt at solving it. Keeping track of your research is
                  vital because itâs helpful to provide examples of similar
                  questions or similar problems and explain why those didnât
                  answer your specific problem or question. It also helps the
                  person answering your question avoid pointing you toward
                  resources youâve already explored, and lets them know that
                  youâve already put in the work.
                </p>
                <h3 id="introduce-the-problem">Introduce the Problem</h3>
                <p>
                  The first thing you do when you ask a questionï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ is to
                  introduce the problem. The first paragraph of your written
                  question should serve as an executive summary of the problem.
                  All the following paragraphs should fill in the details of the
                  problem.
                </p>
                <p>
                  An important thing to include in your problem introduction is
                  a precise explanation of how you encountered the problem.
                  Write about the difficulties that kept you from solving it.
                  Describe what you already tried and include the results of the
                  research youâve done.
                </p>
                <p>
                  You should also provide as much detail about the context as
                  possible. For instance, include the language version, the
                  platform version, the operating system, the database type,
                  specific IDE, and any web server information. You should also
                  include your particular constraints. For example, you may not
                  be allowed to use feature A or B that would provide an obvious
                  solution. If you have an odd constraint, it may also help
                  explain why you have that constraint.

                  One thing to remember is that not all questions benefit from
                  including code. However, if you include code, definitely do
                  not just copy in your entire program! By having irrelevant
                  details, you make your question much harder to answer and
                  decrease the chances of someone helping you.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Here are some guidelines for when to include code in your
                  question.
                </p>
                <h3 id="minimal"><strong>Minimal</strong></h3>
                <p>
                  Include just enough code to allow others to reproduce your
                  specific problem.ï¿¼ï¿¼ One way to do this is to restart from
                  scratch. Do not include snippets of your entire program.
                  Instead, create a new program, but only add whatâs necessary
                  to recreate the problem.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If you arenât exactly sure where the problem code is, one way
                  to find it is by removing code chunks one at a time until the
                  problem disappears â then add back the last part. This way,
                  you can deduce that the last piece of code you added back is
                  likely the source of your problem.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Be careful not to remove too much code, either. Keep your
                  question brief, but maintain enough context for clarity.
                </p>
                <h3 id="complete">Complete</h3>
                <p>
                  Make sure you include all the portions of the code needed to
                  reproduce the problem. It would be best if you assumed that
                  the person who is answering your question would not write any
                  code to reproduce your issue. Again, remember, do not use
                  images of codeâthose trying to help you need direct access to
                  the code you include in your question.
                </p>
                <h3 id="reproducible">Reproducible</h3>
                <p>
                  When you include your code, itâs also important to tell the
                  reader exactly what you expect the behavior to be. Be sure to
                  show the reader the exact wording of the error message you
                  encountered (if there was one). Itâs also crucial to
                  double-check that your included example reproduces the
                  problem.
                </p>
                <p>
                  One other thing you can do is create a live example on a site
                  like sqlfiddle.com or jsbin.com. If you do, make sure you also
                  include a copy of your code in your question. Not everyone
                  will utilize the link to the live example.
                </p>
                <p>
                  And to reiterate, do not post images of any code, data, or
                  error messagesâreserve images for things like rendering
                  bugsâthings that are impossible to describe accurately with
                  just text.

                  Donât send a question you havenât proofread. When you post
                  your question, you should have already read and reread it,
                  taking care to follow all the best practices and making sure
                  your question makes sense. It would be best if you imagined
                  that youâre coming to your question fresh, with no other
                  context but the question itself. You want to make your
                  question as easy for someone to answer as possible. Remember,
                  the reader is likely choosing between several questions they
                  could answer. You want your question to stand out as something
                  concise and approachable. Donât forget to double-check your
                  spelling, grammar, and formatting. Keep it as straightforward
                  as you can; youâre not writing a novel.

                <p>
                  As feedback and responses to your question begin coming in,
                  respond as quickly as possible. Youâll likely receive
                  clarifying questions, and your readers need that clarification
                  to help you.

                  Now letâs look at an example of a question posted to Stack

                </p>
                <p>
                  The first thing to notice is that the post has a short but
                  descriptive title that adequately summarizes the question.
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>Accessing the index in âforâ loops?</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  Next, did the questioner provide any additional context or
                  proof of the research theyâve done so far? It doesnât look
                  like it. They could improve the question by including what
                  they tried and the resources they explored.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The questioner did an excellent job of introducing the
                  question and including code that shows what they are trying to
                  do. In this case, they did not need to include experience vs.
                  expected behavior; they just needed to have the expected
                  behavior. By clearly stating what the desired result was, it
                  helped the person answering to respond appropriately.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The code they included is a minimal and complete example,
                  allowing someone to reproduce the problem quickly. The
                  questioner left out irrelevant details and code that wouldâve
                  distracted from the primary question. They also included an
                  example of what the desired output would be, which is helpful.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It appears the questioner proofread their question beforehand
                  as it does not contain any glaring spelling, grammar, or
                  formatting problems. However, we could critique this example
                  for including a redundant sentence at the end. Instead of
                  including that sentence, they might have rephrased the first
                  sentence of the question to be more precise.
