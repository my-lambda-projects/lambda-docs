# React Components and Component State

<span class="lead"> </span>

Components are the building blocks of React applications. We use components to display some data (often called “state”) to the screen for our users. In this module, we will learn how to build components that can hold state to create a great experience for our end users.

**At the end of this module, you should be able to:**

-   describe ReactJS and the problems that it tries to solve
-   explain what components are and how they work in React
-   explain what state is in web applications and demonstrate how to make a React component stateful
-   change the state of the component with a click listener

#### Pro Tip

Treat everyone with as much respect and integrity as you wish to be treated with.

#### Learn to describe ReactJS and the problems that it tries to solve

There are many frameworks and libraries out there trying to accomplish the same thing: provide developers with the ability to build large scale applications effectively. In today’s world, software changes fast, and these libraries and frameworks allow us to write software and deploy our changes to our systems rapidly enough to keep up with demand. One of the most popular libraries out there for building applications today is [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/).

It is really important to understand that React is just a single paradigm, or one of many ways to write large applications. There are many benefits to starting out with this particular library, especially as new developers, because of the way it leans you toward learning more about JavaScript and it doesn’t force you to rely on too much of its API in order to get things done. This allows for one to gain much more in depth knowledge about the JavaScript programming language, because you get a chance to write a lot of vanilla from within the React ecosystem.

##### Overview

React has quickly become one of the most commonly used libraries for building applications today. Because you’ve now seen some code that allows you to build custom components with so-called vanilla Javascript, you’ve come to an understanding of how you can use JS to manipulate DOM elements. React is going to take that knowledge you have learned, and abstract away a lot of the `document.getElementByClassname` syntax. As you’ll see later on, your entire application will live within one targeted DOM element. React will handle the rest for you.

Because we have such rich user interfaces today that interact with ever-changing data, users interacting with DOM elements, and lots of animations and events firing, the DOM is certainly doing a lot of work. Imagine an app like Twitter or Facebook that has users clicking all over the place, with data changing and almost instant status updates. For these types of large scale applications, React is very important. Simply put, we need a way to offload a lot of the `state` (data) that our apps need to use, from the DOM. To keep up with today’s demands of the web, we need a way to build applications that can take care of a lot of the work for us.

Lets face it, working with the DOM API is hard. The React team recognizes this, so they built a simple engine called the `virtual DOM` that interacts with the actual DOM for us. We tell the `virtual DOM` which elements and `state` (data) to render to the actual DOM, and it will do so. Beyond that, it will “react” when the `state` (data) in our app changes, and will update the DOM accordingly. All on its own!

In a process called “reconciliation”, React will detect that the state of the app has changed. Then it will update the virtual DOM, taking note of which nodes have changed due to the state changes. Finally, once it knows which nodes have changed, it will update only those specific nodes on the actual DOM. This takes a lot of pressure off of our browsers and it’s why React is as powerful as it is.

Today, web applications are enormous, complex pieces of software that millions and millions of users interact with simultaneously. React provides a smooth experience for our users, as well as those developing applications.

#### Learn to explain what components are and how they work in React

Everything you’ll do in React will revolve around components. They are the building blocks of any react application. There are actually a few different types of React components that are commonly seen today in use by React developers. Today you’ll learn about a simple function component and you’ll learn how to build one on your own to display some state on the DOM using different DOM elements.

##### Overview

### Anatomy of a React Component

    import React from 'react';

    const Intro = () => {
      return (
        <div>
          <h1>Hi Lambda!</h1>
        </div>
      );
    };

This is an example of a React “component.” A “component” is a pretty loose term to describe a discrete chunk of your site. A header could be a component, for example. Or a footer. Or a hero section, etc. This one’s pretty simple, all we’re doing is rendering a `div` with an `h1` inside of it.

his is going to generate pretty much what you’d expect.

<img src="https://tk-assets.lambdaschool.com/e8f09b78-8ada-456b-a058-8135567bed50_hi_lambda.png" width="300" alt="hi lambda component" />

So what’s so odd about this? Well, we’re mixing two different syntaxes here. Part of this block is a regular Javascript function and part is HTML.

Javascript:

    const Intro = () => {
      return (
       ...
      );
    };

HTML:

        <div>
          <h1>Hi Lambda!</h1>
        </div>

That’s weird! You can’t do that in JavaScript so what the heck is going on here? We don’t need to understand all the details yet, but the basic idea is that the above block only looks like HTML. In actuality, it is something else.

The fake HTML is called JSX and underneath its disguise, it’s just a JavaScript object. This is a simplification, but what our example above effectively translates into is something like this.

    import React from 'react';

    const Intro = () => {
      return (

          {
              type: 'div',
              props: {
                  children: {
                      type: 'h1',
                      props: {
                          children: "Hi Lambda!"
                      }
                  }
              }
          }

      );
    };

So when we return what looks like HTML in a React component, what we’re secretly returning is a JavaScript object that describes the kind of HTML we want to make. React is going to figure out how to make it for us later.

It’s important to understand early on that a React component is just a regular JavaScript function. We could return an object (sort of) like the one written above, and it would work, but we want to use JSX for a couple of reasons. First, it’s easier to read than that big nested object. And second, it’s going to allow us to put our application’s logic where it belongs: directly next to the thing the logic applies to.

### A brief demonstration of React’s power

In the above example, we’ve hardcoded the text of our `h1` tag to read `Hi Lambda!`. But React gives us the ability to control our app’s content dynamically. Look at this:

    import React from 'react';

    const Intro = () => {
      const greeting = "Hi Lambda!";
      return (
        <div>
          <h1>{greeting}</h1>
        </div>
      );
    };

<img src="https://tk-assets.lambdaschool.com/e8f09b78-8ada-456b-a058-8135567bed50_hi_lambda.png" width="300" alt="hi lambda component" />

Our code changed, but our output is the same. Because we’re just in a regular JavaScript function, we’re free to declare a variable the way we normally do: `const greeting = "Hi Lambda!";`

Once we’re in our JSX, React gives us the power to *escape* back into regular JavaScript and refer to that variable by using the curly brackets `<h1>{greeting}</h1>`.

These curly brakets will evaluate *any* valid JavaScript expression. So if we change`<h1>{greeting}</h1>` to `<h1>{2 + 2}</h1>`

We get:

<img src="https://tk-assets.lambdaschool.com/af9072f7-4853-4742-afde-60f1db84cedf_4.png" width="300" alt="four" />

Now you know the underlying mechanism of React. We don’t want to have to hardcode the content of our HTML; instead, we want to compute it.

By now some of you are probably thinking, “Computing our markup, isn’t that what we learned DOM manipulation for?” and it’s a good question.

### Why do it this way?

We’re going to focus on two major pillars of React’s design philosophy for now. The separation of concerns and declarative programming.

#### Separation of concerns

*How can We know the dancer from the dance*

In computer programming, “the separation of concerns” refers to a design philosophy that each piece of your code should do one and only one thing. Functions with a lot of moving parts are hard to debug. One large function might be tricky to test. If we can split that function apart into smaller pieces that are easy to test individually, our application will be more robust and easier to understand.

At first glance, it might appear that putting our markup right next to our JavaScript is a violation of this principle, but the React team thinks otherwise. They argue that we can’t *truly* separate a `<button>` tag from the function the button invokes. Separating the two, one in an HTML file and another in a JavaScript file, isn’t a separation of concerns, it’s cutting one concern in half and then putting one half in the bedroom and the other half in the garage. It’s a headache we don’t need.

Consider the difference between this, the way you’re used to doing it:

    //HTML FILE
    <button class="button"></button>

    //JS FILE
    let button = document.querySelector('.button');
    button.addEventListener("click", (data)=>{...logic} )

And the React way:

    <button onClick={ () => submitForm(data) } />

I would argue there are a lot more opportunities for something to go wrong in the first approach.

### Imperative Programming vs Declarative Programming

We have an array:

    let myArray = [1,2,3,4,5];

And we want to iterate over it and double each number. Here are two ways we could go about it.

    for (i = 0; i < myArray.length; i++) {
        myArray[i] = myArray[i] * 2;
    }

Or:

    const double =  number => number * 2;

    myArray.map(double);

The first approach is an example of *imperative* code, and this is the kind of approach we’re most familiar with. There’s nothing wrong with imperative code, it’s very explicit, and at a lower level, *all* code is ultimately imperative. The problem with imperative code is it’s pretty difficult and in more complex examples, it can be hard to understand what the code does at a glance.

The second approach is an example of *declarative* code. Instead of telling the computer, step by step, *how* we want it to do something, we just tell it *what* we want it to do.

`myArray.map(double)`

**“Map over my array and double everything inside of it.”**

With practice, declarative code is easier to parse. This is important because, believe it or not, as a programmer, most of your time isn’t spent writing code. It’s spent *reading other people’s code and trying to understand what it does*. If you can grasp this distinction, and appreciate its value, congratulations. You now understand the basis of functional programming, the programming paradigm that React is modeled after.

So now we know the very basics of what React does and why it does it this way. In the next objective, we’re going to introduce one of the single most important concepts in programming: state.

Let’s build a component that displays an image. This is how we would do that.

    import React from "react";
    function App() {
      return (
        <div className="App">
          <img
            src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/92/94/ba/9294badee7b8f3d93fa9bc6c874641b2.png"
            alt="lightbulb"
          />
        </div>
      );
    }

Notice how we have `className` instead of `class` in our JSX? That is because JSX is just JavaScript, and `class` is a reserved word in JS.

Now, one more trick we can do with JSX. We can evaluate JavaScript expressions. So we can read variables, run functions, read data from objects or arrays, all kinds of things! To do this, we use curly braces - `{}`. Here we will use curly braces to render the value of an object property as a header, and then we will evaluate a string variable as the `src` of the image.

    import React from "react";

    const image =
      "https://i.pinimg.com/originals/92/94/ba/9294badee7b8f3d93fa9bc6c874641b2.png";
    const titleObj = {
      title: "Light Bulb!"
    };

    function App() {
      return (
        <div className="App">
          <h2>{titleObj.title}</h2> // this evaluates down to the string "Light
          Bulb!"
          <img src={image} alt="lightbulb" /> // this will evaluate down to the image
          url string for the img src
        </div>
      );
    }

JSX is so powerful!

##### Challenge

Start to build out React components from scratch. Have fun with this. Experiment with different elements.

#### Learn to explain what state is in web applications and demonstrate how to make a React component stateful

Web apps are basically comprised of data (aka state), and things that change that data, or state. It is therefore vital to understand what state is.

##### Overview

You actually already know this, though you may not realize it. If you’re at a soccer game, and each team has three goals, you might say that the “state” of the game is “tied.” A traffic light has three possible states: red, yellow, and green. Similarly, our applications also have states. If you have a to-do app, it might be said to have a state of “three to-dos, none of which are completed.” Upon completing one of the to-dos you’ve changed the application’s state.

To see what this means concretely, let’s start with the simplest state possible: a boolean. We’ll create an app that displays a light. The light will either be on or off.

##### Follow Along

Let’s get some code on the page.

    import React from "react";
    import { render } from "react-dom";
    import "./styles.css";

    const white = "https://image.flaticon.com/icons/png/512/32/32177.png";
    const yellow =
      "https://i.pinimg.com/originals/92/94/ba/9294badee7b8f3d93fa9bc6c874641b2.png";

    function App() {
      return (
        <div className="App">
          <img src={white} />
          <img src={yellow} />
        </div>
      );
    }

    const rootElement = document.getElementById("root");
    render(<App />, rootElement);

This doesn’t quite get us where we want to go.

<img src="https://tk-assets.lambdaschool.com/88214aa0-8105-4c25-a8a6-1be79308052e_same-bulbs.png" width="1000" alt="drawing" />

Our application has the assets we want, but we only want one lightbulb image to show at a time. To achieve this, we’re going to have to keep track of its state.

    import React, {useState} from "react";
    import { render } from "react-dom";
    import "./styles.css";

    const white = "https://image.flaticon.com/icons/png/512/32/32177.png";
    const yellow =
      "https://i.pinimg.com/originals/92/94/ba/9294badee7b8f3d93fa9bc6c874641b2.png";

    function App() {

      const [lightOn, setLightOn ] = useState();

      return (
        <div className="App">
          <img src={white} />
          <img src={yellow} />
        </div>
      );
    }

    const rootElement = document.getElementById("root");
    render(<App />, rootElement);

A couple of things have changed here. First, we’re importing the `useState` hook from the React library so we can use it.

`import React, {useState} from "react";`

Second, we’ve got this odd bit of syntax.

`const [lightOn, setLightOn ] = useState();`

This is the `useState` hook, and it’s fundamental to understanding modern React. If its syntax looks strange to you you’re not alone, but we’ll get back to why it looks like that later. For now, what you should understand is that while the line may look strange, all it’s really doing is declaring two variables the way you normally might. For now, it’s okay to imagine that it’s doing something real close to this:

    let lightOn;
    let setLightOn = (value) => {lightOn = value;};

(Note: ignore the discrepancy between the use of `const` in the hook and `let` in my example. It’s not important for now.)

The sharp-eyed among you might have noticed that `lightOn` doesn’t have a value.  
But as you can see, if we were to invoke `setLightOn` and pass a value in as an argument, we can change the value of `lightOn`.

    setLightOn("sup");
    console.log(lightOn); // "sup"

But what if we don’t want to have to assign a value to `lightOn` right away? What if we want that variable to be initialized with a value from the get-go? We can do that.

Let’s change:

`const [lightOn, setLightOn ] = useState();`

To:

`const [lightOn, setLightOn ] = useState(false);`

Now it’s sort of like we’re saying this:

    let lightOn = false;
    let setLightOn = (value) => {lightOn = value;};

In summation the `useState` hook `const [lightOn, setLightOn ] = useState(false);` works like this:

`lightOn` is a variable the value of which is whatever we passed in to `useState`. In this case, it’s value is the boolean primitive `false`. `setLightOn` is a function that will change the value of `lightOn`. We’ll also note that I could have named `lightOn` and `setLightOn` whatever I wanted. I could’ve named them `peanutButter` and `jelly` if I wanted but that would’ve made it pretty confusing for someone reading my code to understand what they do.

#### Recap State

Okay, so what have we learned? We know what state is in an application. We also know how to keep track of a state variable from within a component, we know how to initilize it with a value, and we know how we can change that value. What’s missing?

Well for one we still have two light bulbs. We have a state variable initialized and a way to change it, but our lightbulbs don’t know it exists. We have to make our lightbulbs aware of what the state is in some way so that they can know what to do when it changes. We’re going to need to learn a critically important pattern to make that happen.

### What is Conditional Rendering?

Conditional rendering is just a fancy name for a very common pattern in React. We don’t want to see both lightbulbs at once. We only want to **render** one or the other based on some **condition**. In this case, if the `lightOn` boolean is set to `false` we want to see the white lightbulb. If it’s set to true we want to see the yellow one. This is a straightforward use-case for the ternary operator in JavaScript.

    import React, { useState } from "react";
    import { render } from "react-dom";
    import "./styles.css";

    const white = "https://image.flaticon.com/icons/png/512/32/32177.png";
    const yellow =
      "https://i.pinimg.com/originals/92/94/ba/9294badee7b8f3d93fa9bc6c874641b2.png";

    function App() {
      const [lightOn, setLightOn] = useState(false);

      return (
        <div className="App">
          {lightOn === false ? <img src={white} /> : <img src={yellow} />}
        </div>
      );
    }

    const rootElement = document.getElementById("root");
    render(<App />, rootElement);

This is the only part that changed:

        <div className="App">
          {lightOn === false ? <img src={white} /> : <img src={yellow} />}
        </div>

A ternary operator acts as a single line `if/else` statment. This line:

`{lightOn === false ? <img src={white} /> : <img src={yellow} />}`

It’s saying *“Is the `lightOn` state variable set to `false`? If so render `<img src={white} />`, otherwise render `<img src={yellow} />`*

Remember this pattern, you’ll use it a lot.

So what’s the result of this code? Well, let’s find out.

<img src="https://tk-assets.lambdaschool.com/0a42bf4e-9454-49a1-b70d-325ba6368fe5_dark-bulb.png" width="1000" alt="drawing" />

Progress. It’s only showing the white bulb. What if we want it to show the yellow one now? Well, remember, our ternary operator is conditionally rendering one lightbulb or the other. It’s being told to show the white one if `lightOn` is set to false, and to show the yellow one if it’s `true`. What happens if we hard code the initial value of `lightOn` to true?

`const [lightOn, setLightOn] = useState(true);`

The result?

<img src="https://tk-assets.lambdaschool.com/782b4acd-8006-4578-8f88-133c7f2b2220_lit-bulb.png" width="1000" alt="drawing" />

Victory is nearly ours. We setup up a condition on which to render one bulb or the other. That condition was based on our application’s state. When we forced the state of the application to change what appeared on the page *reacted* to that change. That’s what React is really all about. Your state changes and your application *reacts*.

The last step is figuring out how to change the state.

Remember our hook from earlier?

`const [lightOn, setLightOn] = useState(false);`

You’ll recall that `setLightOn` is a function that can change the value of `lightOn`. Now we just have to find a way to invoke this function.

##### Challenge

Build a component that holds a `person` object in state. Display the person’s data in the component.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Learn to change the state of the component with a click listener

As we discussed earlier, web apps are really made up of just two things - state and things that change that state. The things that can change state vary, but often times our state is changed by some user interaction in the app. We will learn here how to respond to our users clicking on an element, and change the state accordingly.

##### Overview

You’ve already used click listeners outside of React, so we’re finally going to look at something that feels familiar. To attach a click listener to a react component, we need to use this camel-casing: `onClick`. This event listener will take in a callback function. There are a couple of “gotchas” with this, but don’t worry; we’ll describe them below.

##### Follow Along

Now that we know what the click event listener is in React let’s put one on our `<div>`.

Before we talk about the right way to do this, however, I want to show you a couple of wrong ways. I want to do this for two reasons. 1) It will help us think more critically about how React works and 2) You will almost certainly make this mistake at some point, and it’ll help to know what to look out for.

So again, this is wrong:

    import React, { useState } from "react";
    import { render } from "react-dom";
    import "./styles.css";

    const white = "https://image.flaticon.com/icons/png/512/32/32177.png";
    const yellow =
      "https://i.pinimg.com/originals/92/94/ba/9294badee7b8f3d93fa9bc6c874641b2.png";

    function App() {
      const [lightOn, setLightOn] = useState(true);

      return (
        <div onClick={setLightOn} className="App">
          {lightOn === false ? <img src={white} /> : <img src={yellow} />}
        </div>
      );
    }

    const rootElement = document.getElementById("root");
    render(<App />, rootElement);

This is the relevant line:

`<div onClick={setLightOn} className="App">`

The reason this is wrong is because `setLightOn` is expecting an argument. Wewps! Common mistake. Well, no problem we’ll just pass it one like so:

`<div onClick={setLightOn(false)} className="App">`

Now our code looks like this:

    import React, { useState } from "react";
    import { render } from "react-dom";
    import "./styles.css";

    const white = "https://image.flaticon.com/icons/png/512/32/32177.png";
    const yellow =
      "https://i.pinimg.com/originals/92/94/ba/9294badee7b8f3d93fa9bc6c874641b2.png";

    function App() {
      const [lightOn, setLightOn] = useState(true);

      return (
        <div onClick={setLightOn(false)} className="App">
          {lightOn === false ? <img src={white} /> : <img src={yellow} />}
        </div>
      );
    }

    const rootElement = document.getElementById("root");
    render(<App />, rootElement);

Wewps. Everything broke again. What happened?

Essentially `<div onClick={setLightOn(false)} className="App">` is invoking `setLightOn(false)` over and over again and each invocation is triggering a rerender. We stumbled into an infinite loop. What we meant to write was this.

`<div onClick={ ()=> setLightOn(false) } className="App">`

See the difference?

    // Everything is on fire
    <div onClick={ setLightOn(false) } className="App">

    // Everything is fine
    <div onClick={ ()=> setLightOn(false) } className="App">

The first invokes the function every nanosecond. The second only invokes it when you click the div.

There’s one last little tweak we need to make to get our application to work. Try to figure it out for yourselves before reading on.

### Make our lightbulb app work

In this case, we’re passing `false` as an argument to `setLightOn` every time. That means the state will always be false, which means we’re only ever going to hit one of our two conditions in our render. Instead of passing `false`, let’s pass the opposite of whatever the state is.

`<div onClick={ ()=> setLightOn(!lightOn) } className="App">`

The final code looks like this:

    import React, { useState } from "react";
    import { render } from "react-dom";
    import "./styles.css";

    const white = "https://image.flaticon.com/icons/png/512/32/32177.png";
    const yellow =
      "https://i.pinimg.com/originals/92/94/ba/9294badee7b8f3d93fa9bc6c874641b2.png";

    function App() {
      const [lightOn, setLightOn] = useState(true);

      return (
        <div onClick={() => setLightOn(!lightOn)} className="App">
          {lightOn === false ? <img src={white} /> : <img src={yellow} />}
        </div>
      );
    }

    const rootElement = document.getElementById("root");
    render(<App />, rootElement);

And the result?

<img src="https://tk-assets.lambdaschool.com/ee77a471-9c5e-484f-b857-bcebdfdd444c_changing-bulb.gif" width="1000" alt="drawing" />

It’s glorious.
