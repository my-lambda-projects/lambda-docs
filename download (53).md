#### Learn to understand the Pros and Cons of taking the Java Course

<span id="the_Pros_and_Cons_of_taking_the_Java_Course"></span>

##### Overview

### Software Needed for the course

-   Java Development Kit (JDK) - at least version 11
-   Text Editor
-   GitHub
-   JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA IDE
-   Postman
-   PostgreSQL
-   Heroku

I am glad you are taking the time to look at the Java Course. Of course, I am biased but I think it is a great course. By the way, I am the instructor, John Mitchell! However, I want you to make an informed decision. Should you pursue the Java track or stay with the JavaScript Node track? Keep reading and find out!

### The Good

-   You want a challenge. You want to learn something new. You want to explore a different branch of the programming language family.
-   You want to broaden your skills by learning a new technology. You want something to set yourself apart from other job applications. Java is frequently listed as one of the top three most sought after programming languages.
-   More lines of Java code exist than any other programming language.
-   Java is a broad language, found on everything from IoT devices to full website servers.
-   You appreciate order, structure, and boundaries over a flexible, free-wheeling approach.
    -   I like to think of Java as a Strict Mother (“You must do things my way and you will be fine!”) vs. JavaScript being a Fun Aunt (“Of course you can do that any way you want but it could get you in real trouble!”).

### The Bad

-   You will spend more hours per day learning Java compared to Node (JavaScript). Java is not necessarily harder but it is new.
    -   To be a productive Java programmer, you will need to continue studying Java Spring after the course. Materials and resources are provided to do this. However, this does require extra work on your part!
-   Java is very structured. You code Java’s way or not at all. Node and JavaScript are much more flexible.
-   The Lambda School community is more connected to JavaScript so in the Java course, be prepared to seek a lot of outside help.
-   You have more software to install!

### Other Considerations

-   Are you more interested in being a frontend or backend developer?
    -   If you are leaning towards frontend, stay with Node. Your JavaScript skills will improve.
    -   If you are leaning towards backend, you have a choice!
-   Location. Look into the Job Market where you want to work. Some areas concentrate more on one web stack or another.
    -   Colorado has more Java positions than Node positions.
    -   San Francisco has more Node than Java positions but still has plenty of jobs to go around.
    -   Washington State has a large number of both types of positions.
    -   The Research Triangle in North Carolina tends to favor Java over Node.
    -   Research into where you want to work and see what is available. Quick searches by city on LinkedIn, Glassdoor, and Indeed can give you really good information.
-   Company size. Larger companies tend more towards Java while startups tend more towards Node.
-   Established companies tend to be using Java more than Node. Java has been around longer. This is especially true in established industries like finance and health care.

### Final Thoughts

All that being said, I have spoken to startup companies in Southern California that use Java for their full stack. Bottom line, research the area where you wish to work and companies you wish to work for and then make an informed decision!

I hope you join us in the Java class. If you do not, you can always take the Java class on your own and reach out to me for help! Also, ask to the join the `JX` channel on Lambda School’s Slack - a wealth of information and experience! BTW: JX = Java Experience!!!

#### Learn to understand what to expect in the WEB API Java course

<span id="What_to_Expect_in_the_Java_Course"></span>

##### Overview

![Java](https://lambdaschool.github.io/java-curriculum-assets/Sprint%200%20-%20Welcome%20to%20Java%20Spring/assets/java.png) ![Spring Framework](https://lambdaschool.github.io/java-curriculum-assets/Sprint%200%20-%20Welcome%20to%20Java%20Spring/assets/spring-framework.png)

### Welcome to Java!!!

We will be studying WEB APIs Backend systems written in Java using the Spring Framework.

-   Java is an object oriented, strongly typed programming language
-   Spring is a Framework the extends Java to aid in writing WEB API backend systems, among many other things!
-   We do nothing flashy. We serve up the data that flashy frontend systems use. So what we do might not impress your friends but is the foundation for all information systems in the world!
-   We will be developing software using the following tools
    -   Java Development Kit (JDK)
    -   Spring
    -   JetBrains IntelliJ Idea IDE
    -   Tomcat Webserver

Slack Channels - Where to turn for help

-   A set of Slack channels will be created just for Java
    -   Cohort\_**java**
    -   Cohort\_help\_**java**
    -   TLs remain in the Cohort\_staff channels; we share those
    -   Others might be created as needed
-   You still need to monitor the general cohort channels
    -   Items affecting all students will be posted there
    -   Node items might also be posted in the general channel, but you can ignore those
-   **JX**
    -   You will be added to the JX (Java eXperience channel)
    -   Members include all at Lambda School who are working with Java
    -   Membership is voluntary; you can leave the channel anytime. However, the members of the channel are a great resource!
-   **java**
    -   A Lambda School public channel you are welcome to join.

Working with Technical Material

I have always said that to grasp technical material, you need to go through it 3 times. What we are studying is all technical material. The three stages of understanding technical material are:

-   **Understand the plot**: What are we going to study today
-   **Understand the details**: Now that I know where we are headed, what are the details, the nuances, and the “I need to understand” concepts
-   **Implement the material**: Now that I understand where we are headed and the details that will get us there, let’s use that new knowledge!

This is how I see the material organized for the Java Unit:

-   **Understand the plot**: Watch the pre-class videos in Training Kit. The material covered in the videos is roughly the same as the material in the written documentation of Training Kit. The Training Kit material contains a few key phrases:
    -   **Overview**: This is reading time. Training Kit is conveying new material to you so pay attention!
    -   **Follow Along**: This is time for your hands to be on the keyboard and to follow along what is being done in Training Kit. You will remember much more of the material if you implement it yourself!
    -   **Additional Resources**: These are links to study more about the topic at hand. Some of the links present alternative ways of handling the same topic. These are intended for future, enhancement, and enrichment study!
-   **Understand the details**: Now, you will come to the Guided Project class time with ideas of what we are going to cover. The Guided Project is a time for you to follow along with the instructor to further understand the details of how to implement the topics discussed in Training Kit. The guided project is also a time to see how all the topics come together to form a complete application.
-   **Implement the material**: Now you are on your own to do the Module Project. The written material in Training Kit serves as a great resource for helping you through this project!

Suggestions for success:

-   This is not a competition!
    -   “A creative man is motivated by the desire to achieve, not by the desire to beat others” – Ayn Rand
    -   There are enough Java positions to go around
    -   Work together - a rising tide lifts all boats
-   Yes, it is HARD!
    -   It’s supposed to be hard. If it wasn’t, everyone would do it. “The hard is what makes it great” – Tom Hanks in “A League of Their Own”
-   Learning something new? Follow the 20 Minute Rule:
    -   Researching solution for around 20 minutes
    -   When searching the web
        -   Restrict your searches to just the last year or so. Most search engines have a tool to do this. Java has been around for a while and has changed over the years. You want the latest information!
    -   When asking for help, ask on the channels. This way we all can benefit from the answers. I do monitor the channels.
    -   Answer questions in the channels. The best way to learn something is to explain it to others.
-   Finish!
    -   The economy is run by those who show up. Success comes to those who finish.
-   Career Education Importance
    -   Give your job search as much effort as you are giving to learning the technology
    -   Technical Education + Career Education = **SUCCESS**
-   To be a productive Java programmer, you will need to continue studying Java Spring after the course. Materials and resources are provided to do this. However, this does require extra work on your part.

#### Learn to install Software Needed for the WEB API Java Course

<span id="Install_Software"></span>

##### Overview

### Software Needed for the Course

-   Java Development Kit (JDK)
-   A Text Editor - Instructor will use Sublime - Your pick and you are on your own for installation!
-   JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate Version
-   Postman - An API Client
-   PostgreSQL
-   Configure Environment Variables
-   Heroku Access, including Heroku CLI

Note that some of the Training Kit materials use animated GIFs to highlight certain aspects of the curriculum. Many plugins, extensions, exit to control the playback of animated GIFs. The one I am using is GIF Scrubber. Look for it in your favorite plugin, extension, store!

Find your particular operating system to install the different software!

##### Follow Along

### **JDK**

<span id="Install_the_JDK_Overview"></span> Any version of JDK 8 or later should work with our code. Most people have the Java Runtime Environment Installed. We need the next level, the actual JDK.

The general download site for the JDK is <https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html>ll

<span id="Install_the_JDK_for_Mac"></span>

#### JDK for Mac

![Video Lecture](https://lambdaschool.github.io/java-curriculum-assets/Sprint%200%20-%20Welcome%20to%20Java%20Spring/assets/novideo.png)

-   From the Website <https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html>ll
    -   Pick the first link that says **Oracle JDK: JDK Download**
    -   On the next page, click on the file for **macOS Installer**
    -   Agree to the license agree and download the file.
    -   Double click on dmg file that was just downloaded
    -   Install using the defaults suggested
    -   Double click on the pkg file that appears
        -   Click continue
        -   Click install
            -   You may have enter your password to install
        -   Once installation is done, click close
            -   I then choose to “Move to Trash” the installer

Let’s try out our new installation. From a command prompt enter `java -version` you will see something like `java version "14" 2020-03-17`. This should be the version of Java that you just installed and should closely match the version displayed by the following command.

From a command prompt enter: `javac -version` you will see something like `javac 14`. This should be the version of JDK that you just installed and should closely match the version displayed by the first command.

If this second command (`javac -version`) does not give you the correct version, but does give you a version, you have more that one Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed on your computer.

-   To get a list of the JVMs installed on your computer enter the command at a terminal prompt `/usr/libexec/java_home -V`
-   You will need to make your most recently downloaded JDK your main Java.
    -   From a terminal prompt:
        -   type `cd` to go to your root directory
        -   Make sure you have a .zprofile by entering the command `touch .zprofile`
        -   Type `open .zprofile` to edit your bash profile
        -   In the file that opens, go to the bottom of the file and enter

<!-- -->

    export JAVA_HOME='/usr/libexec/java_home -v 14'

Note: that 14 is the version of Java we just installed above. Enter the version for your JVM download.

-   Save the file, restart your computer, and you should be good to go!
-   For more information on this specific process, see <https://medium.com/@devkosal/switching-java-jdk-versions-on-macos-80bc868e686a>aa

For more information on installing the JDK in general, see <https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/14/install/installation-jdk-macos.html>ll

<span id="Install_the_JDK_for_Windows"></span>

#### JDK for Windows 10

![Video Lecture](https://lambdaschool.github.io/java-curriculum-assets/Sprint%200%20-%20Welcome%20to%20Java%20Spring/assets/novideo.png)

-   From the Website <https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html>ll
    -   Pick the first link that says **Oracle JDK: JDK Download**

    -   On the next page, click on the file for **Windows x64 Installer**

    -   Agree to the license agree and download the file.

    -   You will need to run the file
        -   This can either be done as an option prior to downloading
        -   Or you can launch the file after downloading

    -   Install the software noticing the path where you install the software

    -   Add the path to the TOP of the system PATH
        -   Go to Control Panel -> System -> Advanced System Settings -> Environment Variables
            -   In the System variable group at the bottom of the page, select the Path variable
                -   Click Edit…
                -   Click New
                -   Enter the correct path for the bin folder of your JDK. It will look something like: `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-14\bin` (substituting your version number for the 14)
                -   Click outside the entry box
                -   Using the Move Up button, move this directory to the TOP of your Path
                -   Click OK
            -   Now let’s add the JAVA\_HOME environment variable
                -   In System Variables, click New…
                    -   For the variable name enter `JAVA_HOME`
                    -   For the variable value enter `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-14` - same directory at before without the `\bin`
                    -   Click Ok
            -   Click OK from the next screen
        -   And Click OK one more time
        -   RESTART YOUR COMPUTER!!! This is necessary for the Path change to take effect.

Let’s try out our new installation. From a command prompt enter `java -version` you will see something like `java version "14" 2020-03-17`. This should be the version of Java that you just installed and should closely match the version shown in the following command.

From a command prompt enter `javac -version` you will see something like `javac 14`. This should be the version of JDK that you just installed and should closely match the version displayed by the first command.

If you do not get the correct version, retrace your installation steps paying particular attention to the directory location of the Path variable.

For more information see <https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/14/install/installation-jdk-microsoft-windows-platforms.html>ll

<span id="Install_the_JDK_for_Ubuntu"></span>

#### JDK for Ubuntu

![Video Lecture](https://lambdaschool.github.io/java-curriculum-assets/Sprint%200%20-%20Welcome%20to%20Java%20Spring/assets/novideo.png)

I do most of Linux from a terminal prompt!

Go to a terminal prompt and enter the following commands

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:linuxuprising/java
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install oracle-java14-installer

-   You will need to agree to the Oracle License Agreement

Back in the terminal prompt, enter the following command

    sudo apt install oracle-java14-set-default

Let’s try out our new installation. From a terminal prompt enter `java -version` you will see something like `java version "14" 2020-03-17`. This should be the version of Java that you just installed and should closely match the version displayed by the next command.

From a command prompt enter `javac -version` you will see something like `javac 14`. This should be the version of JDK that you just installed and should closely match the version displayed by the first command.

If you do not get the correct version, retrace your installation steps!

<span id="Install_and_Configure_IntelliJ"></span>

### **IntelliJ**

Home Page for JetBrains IntelliJ Idea <https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/>//

#### Installation of IntelliJ for all OS

IntelliJ Ultimate Edition is installed from your GitHub Student Pack

##### To access the general benefits of GitHub Student Developer Pack

-   Visit your Dashboard and click on the GitHub Student Developer Pack’s unique link. Once you click on it, do not do anything else in it.
-   Visit <https://github.com/settings/billing>gg.
    -   At the bottom of this page, you should see that you have a coupon applied and when that coupon will expire. (Example of how the coupon should look: COUPON $7.00 off for 2 years until July 18, 2021.) If there is no coupon on there, you can use a new link that we can generate for you again. Be sure to reply back that you need it, though.
    -   Once you click on the new link, check the billing page again. If it says that it has been applied, then move onto the next step.
-   Visit [education.github.com/pack/offers](education.github.com/pack/offers)ss. You should be able to see that you can get your benefits there. (This is only the case if the coupon has been applied to your account, which is why you need to check the billing page first. Do not try to reapply or else that will mess up the system!)
-   If, for some reason, you cannot access the benefits and are using Chrome, then please try using Firefox, Opera, or Safari instead. We highly recommend using Firefox for this though even though you will normally see your instructor using Chrome in class.

##### To access the JetBrains IntelliJ Ultimate benefit

-   After doing the above!

-   Please click on the card with the JetBrains logo.

-   Authenticate with your GitHub credentials.

-   You will be guided to a page on the JetBrains website where you can request your free educational license for JetBrains tools.

-   You will get a series of two messages from the JetBrains team asking you to confirm your request and then to activate your educational JetBrains license.

-   If, for some reason, this isn’t working, then please open up a support ticket with JetBrains.

#### Configuration of IntelliJ for all OS

Note: IntelliJ is highly configurable and you are encouraged to explore the configurations. For this section I am showing you how to configure IntelliJ but not everything you may want to configure.

-   Get to the IntelliJ Welcome Screen
-   Click on the `Configure` option
-   Select `Preferences`
    -   Some items to consider
        -   `General` -> `Code Folding`
            -   I usually turn this all off except the option to Show code folding outline.
            -   I am not a fan of hiding code.
        -   `Font`
            -   Specifically allows you to change the font size.
        -   `Code Style` -> `Java`
            -   Allows you to change how the code is reformatted when you do a Code Reformat.
        -   `Plugins`
            -   These are installed from the JetBrains Marketplace and allow you to greatly extend the capabilities of IntelliJ.
            -   We do not need any special Plugins for class but feel free to install and try some out!
-   I have created an export of my Settings if you wish to use those. You can download these from [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Z1Nek3sptA0PFJbCOP4-t_H5Qp-Kj4xa)
-   To import these settings, from the Welcome Screen
    -   Select `Configure` -> `Import Settings`
    -   Pick the file you want to import, in this case `intellij_settings_from_john.zip`
    -   From the check list, pick which settings you wish to import
    -   Click OK and restart IntelliJ for these settings to take affect.
    -   Enjoy your new settings!

#### PostgreSQL in the Cloud (on Heroku)

![Video Lecture](https://lambdaschool.github.io/java-curriculum-assets/Sprint%200%20-%20Welcome%20to%20Java%20Spring/assets/novideo.png)

If for some reason you cannot get PostgreSQL installed on your computer, all is not lost! For the class assignment on RDBMS you can use PostgresSQL on the Cloud system Heroku. This is also useful for when we deploy a PostgreSQL based application to Heroku and need to look at the database itself!

We must first setup Heroku Cloud Access and install the Heroku CLI. You need this anyway so might as well do it now!

Now we need to create a PostgreSQL instance on Heroku. Let’s use the Heroku CLI to do this!

-   From a command / terminal prompt

<!-- -->

    heroku login

-   Pressing a key will launch a web browse where you can sign in Heroku.
-   Enter the username and password of your Heroku account and close out of the web browser.
-   You are then returned, signed in, to the command / terminal prompt.
    -   You will get a message that you are `Logged in as <username>`
    -   If you don’t get this message, repeat the steps! This is a common issue with Heroku CLI.
-   Once you are signed on, create a Heroku app.
-   I like to name my apps &lt; my user name > - &lt; my application name >
    -   my standard username is jrmmba
    -   we are creating a PostgreSQL instance so I will name my app jrmmba-postgresql
    -   note that all app names on Heroku must be unique
-   From a command / terminal prompt, substituting your app name for `jrmmba-postgresql`

<!-- -->

    heroku create jrmmba-postgresql

-   You will receive a prompt that tells you how you can access your Heroku app on the web. In my example, this is `https://jrmmba-postgresql.herokuapp.com/`

-   Now we need to add PostgreSQL to our app. Enter the following command from a command/terminal prompt

<!-- -->

    heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev -a jrmmba-postgresql

-   Now we need to find some Heroku info such as username, database name, password, and host. Enter the following command from a command/terminal prompt

<!-- -->

    heroku config -a jrmmba-postgresql

-   You will get a DATABASE\_URL displayed. This URL contains the information that we need. Below is a sample URL. Underneath it is a layout of the URL. If you copy your URL to a text file and then past the layout of the URL under it, reading the information will be much easier.

<!-- -->

    postgres://szpdsfwndvfcsb:759f951ea4289cabc53bb07128aa60675d2e17ee5e0f92a9d3e0020f[email protected]:5432/d2puqdoih80btl
    posgress://username      :password                                                        @url host                                 :5432/dbname

-   We need the
    -   Username, the characters from the `//` to the second `:`
        -   `szpdsfwndvfcsb`
    -   Password, the characters from the second `:` to the `@`
        -   `759f951ea4289cabc53bb07128aa60675d2e17ee5e0f92a9d3e0020f831cff73`
    -   Host, the characters from the @ to the third `:`
        -   `ec2-18-235-97-230.compute-1.amazonaws.com`
    -   Database name, the characters from the last `/` to the end
        -   `d2puqdoih80btl`

-   Armed with this information, launch pgAdmin ![pgAdmin Icon](https://lambdaschool.github.io/java-curriculum-assets/Sprint%200%20-%20Welcome%20to%20Java%20Spring/assets/pgAdminIcon.png)
    -   This does assume you have tried to installed PostgreSQL for your operating system. Normally pgAdmin gets installed just fine; issues arise with the PostgreSQL database system. If that is not your experience, please ask for help.

-   You may be asked to create a master password or sign in using a master password you have already created. Again I recommend something simple like `password`.

-   We are wanting to get to the following screen. Note your list on the left might vary depending on much you have previously used pgAdmin. Note that pgAdmin loads in your default browser.

![pgAdmin First Screen](https://lambdaschool.github.io/java-curriculum-assets/Sprint%200%20-%20Welcome%20to%20Java%20Spring/assets/JX-SP0-M0-01.png)

-   Create a new server to connect to your app on Heroku
    -   Right Click on `Servers`
    -   From the context menu, choose `Create >` -> `Server...`
-   Under the `General` Tab fill in `Name`. It can be any thing you want. Leave the rest as the defaults.

![pgAdmin Server General](https://lambdaschool.github.io/java-curriculum-assets/Sprint%200%20-%20Welcome%20to%20Java%20Spring/assets/JX-SP0-M0-02.png)

-   Under the `Connection` tab
    -   `Host name/address` is the host listed from Heroku, in my case `ec2-18-235-97-230.compute-1.amazonaws.com`
    -   Leave the `Port` at `5432`
    -   `Maintenance database` should be the database name from Heroku, in my case `d2puqdoih80btl`
    -   `Username` is the username from Heroku, in my case `szpdsfwndvfcsb`
    -   `Password` is the password from Heroku, in my case `759f951ea4289cabc53bb07128aa60675d2e17ee5e0f92a9d3e0020f831cff73`
        -   Do check to `Save password?`

![pgAdmin Server Connection](https://lambdaschool.github.io/java-curriculum-assets/Sprint%200%20-%20Welcome%20to%20Java%20Spring/assets/JX-SP0-M0-03.png)

-   And finally under the `Advanced` tab
    -   `DB restriction` should be set to the database name from Heroku. This makes finding your database on the server MUCH easier! In my case `d2puqdoih80btl`
-   Now you can click `Save`!

![pgAdmin Server Advanced](https://lambdaschool.github.io/java-curriculum-assets/Sprint%200%20-%20Welcome%20to%20Java%20Spring/assets/JX-SP0-M0-04.png)

-   You should now be able to use this Heroku hosted PostgreSQL database like any local database!

<span id="Setup_Environment_Variables_Overview"></span>

### **Environment Variables**

Environment variables have two parts, a name and value separated by an `=`. We use the value in our applications and we find out the value by reading the name. By convention, we make the variable name uppercase. The value is whatever case we need it to be.

-   VariableName=VariableValue
-   MYDBHOST=localhost

We will need some environment variables set up for the rest of the course. We will specifically need the following ones:

For user authentication

<table><thead><tr class="header"><th>Variable Name</th><th>Variable Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td>OAUTHCLIENTID</td><td>lambda-client</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>OAUTHCLIENTSECRET</td><td>lambda-secret</td></tr></tbody></table>

<span id="Setup_Environment_Variables_on_Mac"></span>

#### Environment Variables for Mac

![Video Lecture](https://lambdaschool.github.io/java-curriculum-assets/Sprint%200%20-%20Welcome%20to%20Java%20Spring/assets/novideo.png)

To show what environment variables you currently have, from a terminal prompt enter

    printenv

To show the value of a specific environment variable, from a terminal prompt enter (where `path` is the variable name we are interested in). Case matters!

    echo $PATH

If nothing gets displayed, that environment variable is not set.

To set up permanently the environment variable will need in class, do the following:

-   First you have decided if you need a `.bash_profile` or `.zprofile` configuration file
    -   macOS Catalina and later uses the .`zprofile`
    -   macOS Mojave and earlier uses the `.bash_profile`
    -   It is not wrong to have both. I will be setting up both with the following instructions but you can just do the one for your macOS.
-   Make sure you have the right configuration file in your home directory.

<!-- -->

    cd
    touch .bash_profile
    touch .zprofile

-   Open the `.bash_profile` file for editing

<!-- -->

    open .bash_profile

-   This opens the `.bash_profile` file in your default text editor. Go to the bottom of the file and add the following lines.
    -   Note: The value (text to the right of the = ) for
    -   We will make use of these environment variables later in the course!

<!-- -->

    export OAUTHCLIENTID=lambda-client
    export OAUTHCLIENTSECRET=lambda-secret

-   Save the `.bash_profile` file

-   Open the `.zprofile` file for editing

<!-- -->

    open .zprofile

-   This opens the `.zprofile` file in your default text editor. Go to the bottom of the file and add the following lines.

<!-- -->

    export OAUTHCLIENTID=lambda-client
    export OAUTHCLIENTSECRET=lambda-secret

-   Now save the file and RESTART YOUR COMPUTER.
-   After restarting your computer, use the commands from above to check on the values of the environment variables!

<span id="Setup_Environment_Variables_on_Windows"></span>

#### Environment Variables for Windows

![Video Lecture](https://lambdaschool.github.io/java-curriculum-assets/Sprint%200%20-%20Welcome%20to%20Java%20Spring/assets/novideo.png)

To show what environment variables you currently have, from a command prompt enter

    set

To show the value of a specific environment variable, from a command prompt enter

    set path

If nothing gets displayed, that environment variable is not set.

To permanently set the environment variables we will need in class, do the following:

-   We will make use of these environment variables later in the course

-   Go to Control Panel -> System -> Advanced System Settings -> Environment Variables
    -   In the System variable group at the bottom of the page
        -   Click New…
            -   For the variable name enter `OAUTHCLIENTID`
            -   For the variable value enter `lambda-client`
            -   Click Ok
        -   Repeat those steps for each of the following environment variables - clicking New… and entering the information! Case MATTERS!
            -   <table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td>Variable Name is <code class="highlighter-rouge">OAUTHCLIENTID</code></td><td>Variable value is <code class="highlighter-rouge">lambda-client</code></td></tr></tbody></table>

            -   <table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td>Variable Name is <code class="highlighter-rouge">OAUTHCLIENTSECRET</code></td><td>Variable value is <code class="highlighter-rouge">lambda-secret</code></td></tr></tbody></table>
    -   Click OK from the next screen

-   And Click OK one more time

-   Now RESTART YOUR COMPUTER.

-   After restarting your computer, use the commands from above to check on the values of the environment variables.

<span id="Setup_Environment_Variables_on_Ubuntu"></span>

    export OAUTHCLIENTSECRET=lambda-secret

-   Now save the file (using the following commands if editing with Nano)
    -   Type `Ctrl-x`
    -   Type `y` to save
    -   Press `Enter`
-   Now RESTART YOUR COMPUTER.

### **Heroku CLI**

The installation of Heroku requires that Git be installed on your system (you probably already have it installed).

-   On a Mac, you will need to install the Xcode Command Line Tools. You can do this by
    -   in a terminal prompt, enter `git --version`
    -   A dialog box will popup where you can click `Install` to install the Xcode Command Line Tools.
-   For Windows, we normally install Git Bash from Git for Windows. See <https://gitforwindows.org/>//
-   For Ubuntu See <https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/git.html>ll
