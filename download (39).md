# Deploying Web Apps

<span class="lead"> </span>

Learn how to deploy a web application with Vercel (formerly ZEIT)

**At the end of this module, you should be able to:**

- explain how the world wide web works
- explain what it means to "deploy" a static web app
- demonstrate the ability to deploy and maintain a React App using Vercel

#### Pro Tip

A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over with a working simple system.

#### Learn to explain how the world wide web works

It’s important to have a fundamental understanding of how the web works before we dive into deploying web apps. We will get a look high-level view of what the web is, and how it operates.

##### Overview

The “world wide web” (which we’ll refer to as “the web”) is a part of the internet - which is itself a network of interconnected computers. The web is just one way to share data over the internet. It consists of a body of information stored on web servers, ready to be shared across the world.

### Web Servers

The term “web server” can mean 1) a computer that stores the code for a website or 2) a program that runs on such a computer.

The physical computer device that we call a web server (much like the one shown below) is connected to the internet, and stores the code for different websites to be shared across the world at all times. When we load the code for our websites, or web apps, on a server like this, we would say that the server is “hosting” our website/app.

However, the server itself needs some code to tell _it_ what to do, right? That software program is called… a web server! Its main purpose is to “serve” web pages it retrieves from your project code to users upon request.

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/Wikimedia_Foundation_Servers-8055_35.jpg/2560px-Wikimedia_Foundation_Servers-8055_35.jpg" width="600" alt="Servers" />

While hosting websites has traditionally been a fairly involved task, nowadays, it is quicker than it ever has been before. Gone are the days of setting up a server program through services like Apache, or Window’s IIS, then renting the physical server space from a large company, or buying server hardware.

### How Servers Share Info

When you set up app hosting, what’s the first thing you always do? You open a browser and navigate to the web address to see it live, of course! So how does that work? There are a couple of key components we want to look at that are part of this process.

#### Domain Names and URLs

In 1984, a couple decades _after_ the first computers and networks were invented, the Domain Name Service (DNS) was introduced. This was a concept where computers could distinguish themselves from one another. Six domains that you will probably recognize were introduced: edu (Education), gov (Government), mil (Military), com (Commercial), net (Network Resources), and org (Organization).

Just a few short years later, in 1991, the worldwide web network was opened to the world and incorporated the new HTML computer language. HTML uses specifications for Uniform Resource Locators (URLs). These URLs became (and remain) the universal standard for locating website addresses.

By definition, a URL is a formatted text string referring to the location of a resource on a computer network (most commonly the web). Typically, these resources are web pages, but they can also be text documents, graphics, programs, or pretty much anything that can be stored digitally.

### Bringing It All Together

Combining this all together, we learn that computers can connect to the internet via the world wide web, locate a specific server computer through a URL and domain name, and retrieve information or resources from that server.

##### Follow Along

Now that you know how the web works, read [this article](https://www.doteasy.com/domain-email-and-website-hosting-articles/how-do-websites-work) and send a summary of any additional information you learned to your TL group.

##### Challenge

Research what it means to deploy apps to a server, and the difference between static and dynamic applications.

#### Learn to explain what it means to "deploy" a static web app

Now that we know how the web works, we need to understand what it means to deploy our apps to a server, and to know the difference between static and dynamic applications.

##### Overview

The internet is a great tool, but without data to share with users, it would be useless. Most data on the web is shared through websites and web applications. Let’s talk about how these sites are made available on the web through deployment.

##### Follow Along

### Web App Deployment

Web apps are made up of code - mostly JavaScript. When we want to deploy our web app to the world wide web, we need to host that project on a web server so that it can be served up to people connected to the web. There are many services that allow you to “rent” server space for your web app. You can deploy web apps to Amazon AWS servers, Google Servers, Netlify, Heroku, Gatsby, Github Pages, and Vercel (which we’ll learn about in this module) among many, many others.

Services like these are a huge step up in modern technology that allows us to deploy sites with the click of a button or right in your terminal. We are lucky today that we can do this with so much ease, at least compared to the “good ol’ days”.

### Static vs Dynamic Apps

Deploying a static web app is a little different than deploying a dynamic web app. Most of the apps that you have built up to this point are static apps. A basic definition of a static site is one that has hardcoded data that doesn’t change. A lot of our React apps use data from third-party libraries abut still deploy like a static app.

Deploying a site with an accompanying server and database is going to be more complicated than just an _almost_ static site that consumes a third-party API. We’ll learn more about that kind of deployment in the backend unit.

##### Challenge

Now that you’ve learned what it means to deploy a static web app, do a search online for potential problems that you may face during or after your project is deployed.

#### Learn to demonstrate the ability to deploy and maintain a React App using Vercel

Finally, the moment we’ve been waiting for… Actually deploying some code! Woo hoo! We will be using Vercel to deploy our web apps and maintain our deployments.

##### Overview

To start out, please go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and sign up for an account with your Github profile. Once you do that, move on to the follow-along section to deploy a React app using Vercel.

##### Follow Along

Getting started with Vercel takes just a few steps. You can get up and running with a new project in less than a minute.

### Account Creation & Onboarding

Let’s start by creating a new Vercel [account](https://vercel.com/signup). You can make a new account by logging in with GitHub. You’ll immediately be taken through an onboarding flow, as shown below.

![Vercel onboarding](https://zeit-onboarding.coetry.now.sh)

Fill out your information, upload an avatar, and proceed to installing the GitHub integration.

![GitHub integration](https://github-integration-onboarding.coetry.now.sh)

Click the _Setup Now For GitHub_ button and you’ll be taken to GitHub to finish the installation process. If you are a part of other GitHub organizations, you’ll be given all the different organizations that you can install the integration for. Most likely, you only have a personal account, so go ahead and install it there.

![install GitHub integration to account](https://install-now-to-gh-account.coetry.now.sh)

You’ll then be given the option to install the integration for all of your repositories, or select repositories. You’ll want to enable this for everything because you always have control over whether or not you want to deploy a repository or not from the Vercel dashboard.

![install GitHub integration to all repos](https://install-now-on-all-gh-repos.coetry.now.sh)

After you install the integration, you’ll be taken back to the onboarding flow where you should see a success message like the one shown below.

![integration install success](https://integration-install-success.coetry.now.sh)

Finally, you’ll be taken to the last part of your onboarding process, which is to deploy one of the starter templates. Select the `React` starter to deploy a `create-react-app` template.

![react template](https://react-template.coetry.now.sh)

You’ll then be taken to a page where you can name the project. Feel free to change it to whatever you wish.

If you do change the Vercel project name, it’s a good idea to also change the GitHub repository name to keep things consistent.

GitHub repositories are checked private by default, but if you want to share your work with your classmates and instructors you should uncheck this.

![create and deploy project](https://create-and-deploy-project.coetry.now.sh)

Upon creating your project, you’ll be taken to the project overview page where you’ll find all your deployments for the project. If you initially see a message that says “No deployments found in this project.”, ignore that and refresh the page. You should find a URL for your deployment. Click it and you’ll be taken to the deployment overview page, where you can find build logs and runtime logs.

![project overview](https://project-overview.coetry.now.sh)

Give your deployment about a minute to finish building and refresh the page. You should see a preview screenshot as well as a `READY` status. Congratulations on your first deployment! Click on the image preview or the blue _Visit_ button and you’ll be taken to your deployment.

![deployment overview](https://deployment-overview.coetry.now.sh)

##### Challenge

Do you have a domain name? Maybe for your portfolio site? Follow the instructions [here](https://Vercel.co/docs/v2/advanced/domains/transferring-a-domain/?query=domain_) to transfer your domain to Vercel, and deploy and maintain your project with Vercel. If you don’t have a domain name yet, look through the Vercel documentation and find a guide that is interesting to you [here](https://Vercel.co/guides/).
