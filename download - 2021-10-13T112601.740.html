                <p>
                  There are three operating systems that are primarily popular
                  on general purpose computers - Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There are two operating systems that are essential for popular
                  handheldsâAndroid and iOS.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There are dozens of UNIX variants for simpler processors
                  available. Typically when working with a small dedicated cpu
                  (like an ARM CPU on an IoT device), the operating system
                  supported for that device has been defined by the manufacturer
                  of the device and is a subset of Linux.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Each operating system has its own advantages and
                  disadvantages. Letâs examine some of their strengths.
                </p>
                <h5>Overview</h5>
                <h3 id="windows">Windows</h3>
                <p>
                  Original popular OS for consumers, no permissions enabled fast
                  and easy development, high performance for games and other
                  user applications. Became a difficult model to maintain with
                  the rise of the internet, leading to many revisions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Backwards compatibility is the hallmark of Windows, which
                  causes endless headaches for modern developers.
                </p>
                <h3 id="linux">Linux</h3>
                <p>
                  Started by Linus Torvalds, who was at the time a student of
                  Andrew Tanenbaumâs, the Linux kernel is a copy of the MINIX
                  kernel, which had been created by his instructor. MINIX is
                  copy of the POSIX, an industry standardized system interface
                  that was originally released in 1988. At the time there were
                  many variants of UNIX, all limited to mainframe computers like
                  VAX and PDP systems. The core of UNIX at this time is POSIX,
                  which is the basis for essentially every successful operating
                  system except Windows.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There are dozens of Linux forks at this time, called distros.
                  Ubuntu is the most famous and successful of these, and unless
                  you want to build up a career in system administration it is
                  not necessary to learn any others. The basics of the Linux
                  operating system depend on a few basic philosophies -
                  processes that accept streams of text as input and produce
                  streams of text as output (pipes), file descriptors as
                  references to device drivers and other hardware (including
                  individual files stored on a permanent storage medium), and
                  security enforced by basic access controls applied to every
                  component of the system.
                </p>
                <p>Development paradigms:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p>C and C++ native development.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      Management of symbolic and dynamic links via /usr/lib and
                      /usr/local/lib and /usr/include and many more.
                      Dependencies in linux are stored in files with specific
                      paths, and can either be built natively using
                      <code class="highlighter-rouge">gcc</code> or loaded using
                      package management.

                </h3>
                <p>
                  macOS is another fork of UNIX, now called Darwin but
                  previously FreeBSD, which was created in the 90s by Berkely
                  (Berkeley Software Distribution). OS X features a kernel and
                  basic system libraries that are nearly identical to Linux,
                  with many small differences. OS Xâs graphics layer, Cocoa,
                  differs substantially from Linux graphics layers, features
                  much greater reliability and consistency, and uniquely
                  supports development in Objective-C and Swift.

                  Learn to clearly describe the boot process
                </h4>
                <p>
                  âBooting upâ a computer refers to the process of loading a
                  computerâs operating system into memory so that other
                  applications can be run. The process is relatively similar for
                  each of the major operating systems. Major steps of the boot
                  process are described below.
                </p>
                <h5>Overview</h5>
                <h3 id="basic-inputoutput-system-bios">
                  Basic Input/Output System (BIOS)
                </h3>
                <p>
                  When your computer first boots, it provides power to various
                  electronics components according to the design of the
                  hardware. As each component powers up it executes a Power On
                  Self Test (<em>POST</em>). If POST succeeds, a very small
                  operating system is activated with low level drivers to read
                  and write memory, hard disks, simple display output, and
                  potentially network cards.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The BIOS attempts to read the first sector of the boot disc.
                  In the first sector is the Boot Loader, which shows the BIOS
                  which hard disk sector to execute first in order to activate
                  the real operating system.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In Windows, the Boot Loader is called the Master Boot Record.
                  In Linux, it is GRUB or LILO. OS Xs Boot Loader is entirely
                  proprietary.
                </p>
                <h3 id="boot-loader">Boot-loader</h3>
                <p>
                  The first-stage boot loader is stored in the BIOS and
                  generally reads the first sector from the boot disk which
                  contains a small program for continuing to load. The small
                  program (usually just a few hundred bytes of machine code)
                  loads and executes the second-state boot loader.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The second-stage, more-complicated boot loader (e.g. GRUB)
                  then does the heavy lifting of loading the rest of the OS.
                  Once the kernel is loaded, the boot loader transfer control to
                  it to continue the boot process.
                </p>
                <h3 id="kernel-boot-process">Kernel Boot Process</h3>
                <p>
                  Once the kernel has been loaded, it sets up the execution
                  environment for future processes, initializes hardware
                  drivers, and then switches to <em>multiuser</em> mode.
                </p>
                <p>
                  At this point, it is free to initialize other services that
                  the owner has configured, e.g. MongoDB, sshd, etc.

                  Once we have booted up our machine, how does it actually
                  manage all of the different applications we want run? Because
                  computers have finite resources, the kernel helps manage what
                  resources are allocated to different tasks (otherwise known as
                  processes or threads). How it does this is described in more
                  detail below.

                <p>
                  The Kernel is a compiled program that runs the CPU and every
                  piece of fundamental hardware and software in your computer.
                  The Windows and OS X kernels are completely secret and
                  proprietary, but the Linux kernel is available on github (btw,
                  Linus Torvalds also built Git)!

                <p>
                  This enables curious developers to build and install a new
                  kernel to their own computer. This is the only opportunity for
                  this outside of private employment with Microsoft or Apple.

                <h3 id="processes">Processes</h3>
                <p>
                  Every operating system provides the fundamental concept of a
                  process. Processes are applications that run in user space.
                </p>
                <p>
                  An application might spawn many processes over the course of
                  its run.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Processes in modern operating systems run in their own
                  <em>address spaces</em>. That is, each process thinks it has
                  its own copy of RAM all to itself. Variables declared in one
                  process are not visible from other processes unless both
                  processes explicitly agree to communicate. (Contrast to
                  threads, below.)
                </p>
                <h4 id="process-table">Process table</h4>
                <p>
                  The operating system allocates a list of processes called the
                  process table. The process table is an array data about each
                  process, such as where in memory its stack is located, what
                  local data is needed for the currently executing stack frame,
                  the ID of the process (<em>pid</em>), and much more.
                </p>
                <h4 id="process-lifecycle">Process Lifecycle</h4>
                <p>
                  In Unix, a process is created with the
                  <code class="highlighter-rouge">fork()</code> system call made
                  by the <em>parent process</em>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A process exits when itâs
                  <code class="highlighter-rouge">main()</code> returns, when it
                  calls <code class="highlighter-rouge">exit()</code>, when it
                  is killed, or when it crashes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After the process exits normally, it exists in a
                  <em>zombie</em> state until the parent calls
                  <code class="highlighter-rouge">wait()</code> to get exit
                  status information from the child process.
                </p>
                <h3 id="threads">Threads</h3>
                <p>
                  At the OS level, threads are processes that share an address
                  space.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In a typical use case, a single process will spawn a number of
                  threads to handle various tasks. Each thread has access to all
                  the global data in the process.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Synchronizing access to shared data across multiple threads
                  (so they donât step on each others toes) is a tricky problem.
                </p>
                <h3 id="scheduling">Scheduling</h3>
                <p>
                  The kernel is responsible for sharing resources on a system
                  between multiple processes. In the early days of large
                  mainframes, operating systems did not support multi-tasking.
                  Booting a computer might load the basic resources necessary to
                  access registers, memory, and I/O. Once that boot process was
                  complete, the system would load a single program which would
                  run until completion.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Modern operating systems support mult-tasking, which means
                  that the operating system runs multiple applications at the
                  same time. Because a CPU in general can only perform one
                  activity at a time, the operating system loads processes,
                  their stack frames, and their stack resources in a round-robin
                  fashion.
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    If your computer has 4 cores, it can only actually run 4
                    programs at once. You might have hundreds of processes that
                    need to run, though. The kernel decides which process gets
                    some run time next. In any given second, a large number of
                    processes might be switched into and out of a core.
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  Each time a process is paused, its entire execution state is
                  saved into main memory. The next processes stack frame is
                  loaded from main memory, and execution is resumed.

                <p>
                  The operating system is responsible for providing user
                  programs access to memory. The operating system creates a
                  stack frame at the beginning of a programâs execution and
                  allocates a section of available free memory for it to
                  utilize. The programâs memory space begins essentially at 0,
                  and it has no knowledge of any memory outside of the memory
                  that has been allocated to it by the operating system.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This is one of the fundamental attack vectors used in
                  attempting to take malicious control of a computer. The
                  operating system is responsible for perfectly isolating each
                  process from one another - if a process is able to gain access
                  to memory other than what has been assigned to it it will be
                  able to hijack the system.

                <h3 id="drivers">Drivers</h3>
                <p>
                  Drivers combine, assembly language, C code, and
                  interrupt-driven programming to provide software control of
                  physical devices. The drivers hide the dirty details of
                  talking to the hardware from software developers. Then they
                  present a consistent, easy-to-use programming interface. For
                  example, a driver might know the details about how to talk
                  specifically to an NVIDIA graphics card. Normal programmers
                  donât need or want to know those details. They just want to be
                  able to tell any 3D card from any manufacturer how to draw a
                  scene. For that purpose, the driver exposes an OpenGL or
                  Direct3D interface that the programmers can use.
                </p>
                <p>
                  On general purpose computers like Kaby Lake machines, all
                  drivers are written to control hardware on the other side of
                  the PCIx bus. Hardware is built with a PCIx bus controlller,
                  and driver commands configure binary messages to be sent and
                  retrieved from the hardware over that bus.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In smaller systems like IoT and firmware devices, the bus may
                  be a true parallel bus that is shared between the CPU and the
                  device. These buses are synchronized by the system clock.
                  Drivers on these systems have to know how to take control of
                  the hardware device at the hardware level and can be written
                  to any degree of specificity.

                  organizes files on disk. When you want to read a file, the OS
                  must go retrieve the blocks of the file until it has them all
                  loaded.

                    <p>
                      In networking, each layer adds a wrapper around the data
                      with more information about data integrity or routing or
                      another information.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      At the highest level, you have your data that you want to
                      transmit. As it is prepared for transmission on the
                      network, the data is <em>encapsulated</em> in other data
                      to help it arrive at its destination. Any particular piece
                      of data will be wrapped, partially unwrapped, and
                      re-wrapped as it moves from wire to wire across the
                      Internet to its destination.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The act of wrapping data puts a new <em>header</em> on the
                      data. This header encapsulates the original data,
                      <em>and all the headers that have been added before it</em
                      >.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Here is an example of a fully-encapsulated HTTP data
                      packet.

                      As the data leaves your LAN and heads out in the world,
                      the Ethernet header will be stripped off, the IP header
                      will be examined to see how the data should be router, and
                      another header for potentially a different protocol will
                      be put on to send the traffic over DSL, a cable modem, or
                      fiber.

                    <p>
                      The Ethernet header is created and managed by the network
                      drivers in the OS.

                    <h3 id="sockets">Sockets</h3>
                    <p>
                      Under Unix-like operating systems, the
                      <em>sockets API</em> is the one used to send Internet
                      traffic. It supports both the TCP and UDP protocols, and
                      IPv4 and IPv6.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The sockets API gives access to the IP and TCP layers in
                      the diagram above.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      A <em>socket descriptor</em> is a number used by the OS to
                      keep track of open connections.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      You can create a new socket (socket descriptor) with the
                      <code class="highlighter-rouge">socket()</code> system
                      call.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Once created you still have to <em>bind</em> it to a
                      particular IP address (which the OS associates with a
                      particular network card). This is done with the
                      <code class="highlighter-rouge">bind()</code> system call.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Once bound, you can read and write data to the socket
                      using the
                      <code class="highlighter-rouge">recv()</code> and
                      <code class="highlighter-rouge">send()</code> system
                      calls.

                    <h3 id="http">HTTP</h3>
                    <p>
                      The final piece of information needed for web traffic is
                      the <em>HyperText Transport Protocol</em> (HTTP). While
                      TCP deals with general data integrity and IP deals with
                      routine, HTTP is concerned with
                      <code class="highlighter-rouge">GET</code> and
                      <code class="highlighter-rouge">POST</code> requests of
                      web data.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Like the other stages of networking, HTTP adds a header
                      before the data it wants to send with the packet. Like IP
                      and TCP, This header has a well-defined specification for
                      exactly what needs to be sent.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Though the specification is complex, a fortunately small
                      amount of information is needed to implement a barebones
                      version.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      For each <em>HTTP request</em> from a client, the server,
                      sends back an <em>HTTP response</em>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Here is an example HTTP
                      <code class="highlighter-rouge">GET</code> request and
                      response using version 1.1 of the HTTP protocol getting

                      A web server is a piece of software that accepts HTTP
                      requests (commonly GET requests for HTML pages), and
                      returns responses (commonly HTML pages). Other common uses
                      are GET requests for images within web pages, and POST
                      requests to upload data to the server (e.g. a form
                      submission or file upload).

                        <p>
                          Right after that, call the appropriate handler based
                          on the request type (<code class="highlighter-rouge"
                            >GET</code

                          <code class="highlighter-rouge">/d20</code>, etc.) You
                          can start by just checking for
                          <code class="highlighter-rouge">/</code> and add the

                          Another hint:

                          instead to give them a â404 Not Foundâ response.

                      Write a program that spawns a child process with
                      <code class="highlighter-rouge">fork()</code>. Have the
                      parent print âI am the parent!â. Have the child print âI
                      am the child!â. Then both processes should exit.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Hint: <code class="highlighter-rouge">man fork</code> or
                      <code class="highlighter-rouge">man 2 fork</code>. Pay
                      attention to the return value from
                      <code class="highlighter-rouge">fork()</code>. Itâs a

                    <p>
                      Warning: donât run
                      <code class="highlighter-rouge">fork()</code> in a loop
                      unless youâre careful. You can easily spawn so many
                      processes the system is brought to its knees. For the
                      above assignment, thereâs no need for a loop.
