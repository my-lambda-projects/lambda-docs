# DOM II

<span class="lead"> </span>

Events are the way we users interact with the page. Any time there is some interaction by way of a mouse, keyboard, etc., the DOM creates and propagates an event object. This event object carries information about the event so that it may be handled at any point up the tree from the point of origin.

**At the end of this module, you should be able to:**

- install Node on Windows (if needed)
- install Node on Mac (if needed)
- explain what events are in the browser window, and how event listeners can listen for those events.
- add event listeners and event handlers to elements
- recognize event propagation and the method used to prevent it

#### Pro Tip

Treat everyone with as much respect and integrity as you wish to be treated with.

#### Learn to install Node on Windows (if needed)

---

#### Learn to install Node on Mac (if needed)

Package managers allow developers to install several code dependencies with just a few commands. We will be using npm as our go-to package manager here at Lambda.

##### Overview

In preprocessing, there are three main concepts we need to understand:

1.  The language or syntax that we use to write our code (LESS)
2.  The compiler that converts the language (Node)
3.  The CSS output from the compiler (Normal CSS)

This module focuses on the compiler. For us to use our language (LESS), we need to have a compiler that understands that specific language input.

A compiler is a program that converts language into code. In our case, LESS is the language, and CSS is the outputted code. We utilize compilers to provide more features than standard CSS can offer.

##### Follow Along

Installing our working environment can be daunting at first. We will be covering a lot of ground. Get through each step before going back and trying to learn everything you did.

If you are on a mac, follow the mac instructions below. If you are on a PC, scroll down after the mac instructions to the PC instructions. If you are on Linux, chances are Node is already installed in your system. Run `node -v` in a shell to make sure, and then you can look at step 3 in the mac instructions.

### Step By Step Install Instructions for Mac

**_Step 1: [Install Homebrew and Node](https://brew.sh/)_**

- Follow the instructions on how to install Homebrew using your terminal
- Pay attention to your terminal as the installer will ask for a password
- Once Homebrew is installed, run `brew install node` in your terminal
- Pay attention to your terminal, as there might be small issues to troubleshoot
- Restart your terminal after installation
- Run `node -v` in your terminal to make sure node was installed correctly

**_Step 2: Install Less_** _NOTE:_ You will see our commands have `-g` in them. Please write the commands exactly as you see them. Globally installing packages is ideal for our situation.

- Open terminal and run `npm install -g less`
- If it’s not working, restart your terminal and try again

**_Step 3: Install less-watch-compiler_**

- Open the terminal and run `npm install -g less-watch-compiler`

**_Step 4: Use less-watch-compiler On Your Project_**

- Fork and clone [Preprocessing-Part-I](https://github.com/LambdaSchool/Preprocessing-Part-I)
- `cd` into your project on your local machine
- Once you are in the root of your project run `less-watch-compiler less css index.less`
- Your project should be up and running, change some styles around in your .less file, and save the file to make sure you see a change in your CSS.
- Great work, you’re all set up!

### Step By Step Install Instructions for PC

**_Step 1: [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)_**

**_Step 2: [Install Git Bash (Git SCM)](https://git-scm.com/download/win)_**

- After the installer finishes, open git bash and run `node -v` to make sure node is installed correctly
- If you don’t see some node version numbers display in your git bash window, restart git bash and try again

**_Step 3: Install Less_**

_NOTE:_ You will see our commands have `-g` in them. Please write the commands exactly as you see them. Globally installing packages is ideal for our situation.

- Open git bash and run `npm install -g less`
- If it’s not working, restart your git bash and try again

**_Step 4: Install less-watch-compiler_**

- Open git bash and run `npm install -g less-watch-compiler`

**_Step 5: Use less-watch-compiler On Your Project_**

- Fork and clone [Preprocessing-Part-I](https://github.com/LambdaSchool/Preprocessing-Part-I)
- `cd` into your project on your local machine
- Once you are in the root of your project run `less-watch-compiler less css index.less`
- Your project should be up and running, change some styles around in your .less file, and save the file to make sure you see a change in your CSS.
- Great work, you’re all set up!

##### Challenge

1.  Follow the instructions provided to you in the tutorial above.
2.  Once in your project, change the background color of your body tag to `red`.
3.  Once the background turns red, your compiler is working correctly.

#### Learn to explain what events are in the browser window, and how event listeners can listen for those events.

We will learn what events and event listeners are, and you will be able to explain those concepts. This is the foundation for adding dynamic usability to our sites.

##### Overview

We use Javascript to make our pages dynamic and usable. Now that we can access and manipulate elements on our page, you might be wondering to yourself, “Why don’t we just change the elements in the HTML file directly? Why do we have to go through all of this just to change some styling on an element?” Those are valid questions, and the way we have been using Javascript so far, it would make sense to change our HTML instead.

But, Javascript’s real power lies in its ability to make webpages interactive. In addition to manipulating elements, Javascript also allows us to add features and make modifications to our site by directly reacting to user interactions. Think about a button click, drag and drop, zoom, or any number of user interactions. We create functionality for those interactions using JavaScript. Now that we know how to manipulate and modify DOM nodes, we can learn about events.

Every user interaction with a site is an event: a click, moving the mouse, scrolling the page, pressing a key on the keyboard, these are all events on the page, and the browser can detect all of them. There are tons of different events the browser tracks. When an event happens on a page, it is known as a trigger.

Now that we know what an event is and we know the browser is always tracking them, we need to be able to listen for specific events on specific elements. Did a user click that button? Did a users mouse hover over an element? Was there text entered into the input field? There are dozens of events an element can listen for. When one of those events happens on that element, we can do something about it. The tracking process and subsequent action taken is called an event listener. We put an event listener on an element and give it a callback. When that event is triggered on the element, the callback is run.

---

#### Learn to add event listeners and event handlers to elements

We can chose specific elements to listen to specific events and fire a callback when that event occurs. This is called an event listener.

##### Overview

### .addEventListener

Once we have an element selected, we can use the ‘.addEventListener’ method on that element. `.addEventListener` takes two arguments, first the event to listen for and, second, the callback to fire when that event is triggered. For a complete list of events see the resources below. In use, this looks something like `element.addEventListener('click', callback);`.

### Events

We learned before that there are different types of events we can listen for. The most common are mouse events highlighted by the ‘click’ event, but there are dozens of more events we can listen for. We can add event listeners for as many events as there are for each element, meaning we can listen for a `mouseclick`, `keypress`, `hover`, and more all on the same element. Although to do so we need to call `.addEventListener` and pass in a callback for each one.

Take 5 minutes and study this MDN page. Choose an event that is NOT a mouse event, and read about it and how it works.

[MDN Event Listeners](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events)

### The callback and the `Event Object`

The callback (also known as an event handler) will take a single argument; this is known as the `Event Object`. This is a Javascript Object and contains all we need to know about the event and the element it happened on.

- eg: `element.addEventListener('click', (event) => {//Handle event});`
- One of the most important properties of the event object is `.target`, this property will give us all of the info about the DOM node where the event happened. It has many of the same properties as a regular DOM node, `.children`, `.parent`, `.style`, `innerText`, etc. We can use these properties to manipulate the element itself, or it’s relatives.
- We can use this to manipulate the target in any way we want, for example to change the background color we would write the following: `element.addEventListener('click', (event) => { event.target.style.backgroundColor = 'blue'; });`
- Depending on the type of event listened for, we can have access to other information about the event as well, such as the key pressed (in the form of a code) and other things. Spend 5 minutes reading about the event object here: [MDN Event Object: Properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event#Properties)

#### Learn to recognize event propagation and the method used to prevent it

Event propagation can cause many headaches when dealing with events. It is best to learn how to recognize this feature, and how to properly prevent it from happening, when need be.

##### Overview

Think of a pyramid. Pyramids are made up of many layers, the bottom layer is the largest and as it goes higher, ever decreasing sized layers are added to the one before it. If you are standing on the uppermost layer of a pyramid, you are also standing on every layer below it. When we look at a DOM tree we can see those child elements are nested inside parent elements, like a pyramid. And, like a pyramid, if you stand(trigger an event) on a child element, you are also triggering that same event on every parent element all the way up to the body. This process is called event propagation. If you have an event of the same type on a parent element and a child element, and you trigger that event on the child element, it will also trigger on the parent. We have to be careful not to create unwanted interactions because of this. In the future, you may consider this is a feature, for now, this is something we would like to avoid.

In our event handler, we are passed the event object. The event object has lots of methods and properties on it including one called `.stopPropagation()` if we call this method in our event handler, it will effectively stop our event from bubbling any further up the chain.

- eg: `const eventHandler = (event) => { event.stopPropagation() };`

#### .preventDefault

Some elements have a native default reaction to certain events. For example, form elements will refresh the page on submit. `.preventDefault` is a method on the event object, and it will stop an HTML element from reacting in its default way. `.preventDefault` will be used less than `.stopPropagation`, but it is important to know about as well.

- **[DOM II for WebPT22 w/Keiran Kozlowski](https://youtu.be/6oDYvbUUHXo)**

  Events are the way we users interact with the page. Any time there is some interaction by way of a mouse, keyboard, etc., the DOM creates and propagates an event object. This event object carries information about the event so that it may be handled at any point up the tree from the point of origin.
