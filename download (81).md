#### Learn to recall strategies for getting "unstuck" during a technical interview

##### Overview

Nothing can bring about that panicky feeling like suddenly getting stuck during an interviewer. It’s as bad as freezing from stage fright when you are supposed to be performing in front of a live audience.

You’d expect to get stuck in a normal situation, and you’d probably go to Google or StackOverflow to search for help. However, in an interview, that’s not possible. So, what do you do?

The following are some simple tips and suggestions to make sure you can always get unstuck during an interview.

##### Follow Along

### Remember, You Should Get Stuck

Interviewers choose problems hard enough that they expect to see you get stuck. They want to know how you react and your problem-solving process when you get stuck on an issue.

Contrary to what you’d think, if you quickly solve the problem with no issues whatsoever, the interviewer may assume you’d already seen the problem and feel like they weren’t able to assess your problem-solving abilities honestly.

If you get stuck (as you’d expect) and can problem-solve your way out of getting stuck, this can lead to a positive evaluation and getting hired.

### Getting Started

One of the best ways to get started is to think of the simplest possible version of the problem and solve it for that. Then, slowly introduce complexity by changing the input to more challenging and more problematic cases.

Use a simple input and draw out how you would solve the challenge by hand with pictures and pseudocode. Now, try to generalize the process that you used to solve this simple case into actual code. Look for patterns that you used in your process.

Even if you know that your initial solution is not the most efficient, you can mention that you want to get a working solution first and optimize afterward. It is much easier to optimize an existing, working solution than trying to optimize the ideas that are still just floating around in your ahead. Also, by getting a solution down and then working to optimize it, it is easier for the interviewer to follow and see your entire process.

### Optimizing Your Initial Solution

Always look for optimization hints in the problem description itself. For example, if the problem description mentions that an array is *sorted,* then one likely optimization is to use binary search for lookups in that list.

You should always consider if there is a data structure that you can use to optimize your initial solution. Does your solution have slow lookups? Why not utilize a hash table which has fast lookup operations? Always look at the problem description and see if there is a specific data structure that stands out to work well with the problem.

Look for cases where you’re iterating through the same sequence multiple times. Can you figure out a way to iterate through the sequence only once? Can you utilize a different data structure that will allow you to minimize your iterations?

Try to figure out, conceptually, what the best possible space and runtime complexities are and talk through your reasoning out loud. Then, your interviewer can see your understanding of the problem. Even if you can’t make it as efficient as possible during the interview, they will know that you can analyze a problem and figure out what a good goal for space and time complexity are.

### Last Resort

If you are feeling stuck and cannot figure out a way to get moving again, you should always talk out loud about what you currently know and what your goal for the problem is. If you can articulate *why* you are stuck and precisely what you are stuck with, your interviewer can provide you a good hint to help you get moving again. Remember, this isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Your ability to comfortably articulate why you are stuck on a specific problem is a plus for the interview.

Also, make sure to pay attention to everything your interviewer is saying. They are likely trying to give you hints by even subtle questions they are asking or things they are pointing out in your code. Don’t ignore their questions or comments to drive ahead with your current plan.

##### Challenge

After reading through the suggestions above, where do you feel like you remain the weakest? Is it in your ability to talk about runtime and space complexity? Is it in your ability to articulate your plan for solving a problem out loud? Take some time to reflect on your strengths and weaknesses related to the suggestions above. Come up with a plan for improving and bettering your shortcomings. What is your step-by-step plan for overcoming these weaknesses to make sure you are ready for your first interview, which will likely come relatively soon?

#### Learn to recall strategies for overcoming imposter syndrome during a technical interview

##### Overview

First, let’s start by getting one thing clear, ***you are NOT an imposter***. If you’ve made it this far in your journey at Lambda, you know A LOT, and have grown tremendously. Despite that fact, it is not uncommon to still ***feel*** like an imposter. Let’s go over some strategies for overcoming these feelings, especially when they crop up during an interview or while preparing for an interview.

##### Follow Along

### There is So Much To Know

Computer Science and Data Science are massive fields. You *could* spend your entire adult life studying one small sliver of one of those fields. So, here you are, with maybe only six months of programming experience under your belt. Every new thing you learn only seems to uncover all these other tangential things you *don’t* know. The more you discover your little section of the universe, the more you realize how ***big*** the universe is.

![](https://tk-assets.lambdaschool.com/56cb016f-2152-4b0a-adc0-c91e818bca2e_imposter-syndrom-examples.001.jpeg)

In many ways, this gets worse over time, not better. The more advanced your knowledge gets, the things you don’t know tend to get harder and harder to learn. So, instead of learning some new topic in a week or an evening, you can expect it might take months or years to become comfortable with it.

The critical thing to recognize is that you will always feel this way to a degree. Because, even as you grow in your career and learn more and more, you will still be aware of all there is to know that you currently don’t. Don’t let this fact trick you into feeling like an imposter. You are not an imposter. You know things and have valuable skills and assets, and employers are ready and willing to pay you for them.

### Everyone Else Knows The Hard Stuff

One of the worst tricks we play on ourselves is convincing ourselves that everyone else already knows what we know. So, we look out at the world and our colleagues and classmates and assume that we know the *easy stuff.* All of the stuff that they know that we don’t is the *real, hard stuff***.** This is not true at all.

![](https://tk-assets.lambdaschool.com/ad975bd9-af0a-40ae-8c73-1f2311bd81de_imposter-syndrom-examples.002.jpeg)

In reality, there is a chunk of things that you know that is unique to you among a group of colleagues or teammates. Additionally, each of your teammates has a piece of knowledge that is unique to them. There is some overlap between each of you where you have some shared understanding among each other.

![](https://tk-assets.lambdaschool.com/684edf54-870b-488a-a154-e34560ce70ba_imposter-syndrom-examples.003.jpeg)

So, don’t forget, even as a junior engineer that is joining a new team. You have skills and knowledge that members of your team do not have. And vice versa. This is the normal state of affairs, and it’s okay that your colleagues and teammates know things that you don’t.

### Getting Your Focus Right

So, as you prepare for an interview, you have to make sure to get your mind right. Get your area of focus right. Throughout your time at Lambda, you are always focused on the ever-expanding body of knowledge that you don’t know or that you could know. Additionally, you are growing a network of friends and colleagues, and you see all of the things that they know that you don’t.

But you have to remember that you will never know everything that you could know. You will never know everything that your interviewer knows or that your future colleagues and teammates know. That is perfectly fine, okay, and normal. You are just like everyone else; there is a whole host of things you don’t know.

This fact should make you feel a *part of* not *apart from*. You belong in tech. You can and will get a job in tech. You will keep learning, and yet you will still have things you do not know.

##### Challenge

Spend 5-10 minutes making a list of the things you know and all of the skills you’ve acquired over the years. Go firm on this. I mean, think of *all the things* you know and all the skills you have. After you are done, take a moment to reflect on that list. Please recognize that you bring a lot to the table and remember that it is normal to have lots of gaps in your knowledge and things you don’t know. You will likely need to remind yourself of this often, especially as you go into the interviewing process.
