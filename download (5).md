# Git for Web Development

<span class="lead"> </span>

Git is a distributed version control system. What does that mean to a new web developer? It means that git is used to monitor and control code changes made during development across several people or teams.

Git can be overwhelming at first, but if we break it down concept by concept, it should start to become clear why almost everyone in the industry uses it every day.

**At the end of this module, you should be able to:**

- explain why we use the command line interface (CLI), and demonstrate use of basic CLI commands
- sufficiently explain what version control and Git are, and why as software engineers we use them
- demonstrate an ability to fork and clone a repo
- understand branching, and be able to create a branch locally
- explain and properly utilize the git commands: \`status\`, \`add\`, \`commit\`, and \`push\`
- submit a Pull Request
- demonstrate their ability to use the Lambda School Git Workflow to submit an assignment to your Team Lead

#### Pro Tip

Listen to and learn from the opinions of others. Diverse ideas lead to a better all-around solution.

#### Learn to explain why we use the command line interface (CLI), and demonstrate use of basic CLI commands

The terminal is a very important piece of your software development toolkit. Being able to use the terminal to execute commands is vital for every developer as there won’t be a way to get away from it especially in node and react etc. Your mastery of this topic is essential as you grow and progress as a developer.

##### Overview

The `command line` or `terminal` is a way for us to use our computers without using what are called built in `Graphical User Interfaces (GUI's)` that we’re all used to.

Throughout your career you’ll hear a variety of ways in which we refer to the `terminal`. Some words you may come across are: `terminal`, `command line`, `bash`, `git bash` and `shell`.

Note that there are some differences between the way that different OS’s use the Terminal but these words all refer to pretty much the same thing, a way to give your computer some directions.

It’s important to note that the terminal is `NOT` the `Window's Command Prompt` nor the `Powershell`.

For those windows users who haven’t yet installed `git bash` now would be a great time to do so.

In mac, we’ve gotten used to using the “finder” GUI that looks a lot like this:

![Mac GUI](https://tk-assets.lambdaschool.com/9acb3fbc-1e9f-4eb1-a075-7fa9a8ff3a59_ScreenShot2018-11-26at12.28.22PM.png)

And if you’ve been using Windows, it should look a lot like this:

![windows GUI](https://tk-assets.lambdaschool.com/6fd78941-61cf-4969-9285-4f9b482bc31b_copy-wim.png)

Essentially these GUIs allow us to create, read (open) update and delete files on our hard drive. The `terminal` allows us to do these same things. But it also allows us to do so much more, it allows us to execute commands; commands that can perform operations on our machine.

What we will be learning about today, however is all about how to navigate on your machine using the `terminal`.

### **WARNING** Using the terminal removes a few safe-guards that are currently in place due to the use of GUI’s.

You can do some damage to your machine if you’re not careful. So be wise before executing any commands. Everything we ask you to do with the Terminal here at Lambda School will be safe, but some commands you find on the internet, may not be safe.

The terminal may look a bit intimidating at first, but as you become more and more comfortable with it, it will quickly become as comfortable as your home row on your keyboard.

##### Follow Along

For this follow along assignment we’re going to be practicing a few commonly used commands using `bash` syntax.

Go ahead and open your terminal (on mac) or git bash (on windows) and lets type the following commands in the terminal.

The first command we’re going to type is: \\

    ls

This command stands for list. And what it will do is list all of the items currently found in the current directory you are in. So, when we open our terminals we’re always directed to the `TOP LEVEL` directory aka `root` of our computer. If we were to run `ls` at the top level, we would see all of the folders and files that are currently stored in that top level folder. Later we’ll learn how to use the terminal to move into different folders etc. and we can run LS to see the contents of each folder.

Always run LS to remind you of where you’re at in the terminal, and to quickly check items you have access to.

The next command we will type is:

    cd

This command stands for `change directory` so it’s really simple to imply what this command does here for us, changes what directory we’re currently looking in.

`cd` allows us to move into a folder and is very commonly used in our `git` workflows. All you have to do is give the `cd` command the name of the directory in which you’d like to move. Try running this, and checking your output:

    cd Desktop

You should have moved from the route into your Desktop. Now let’s say you wanted to move into a directory that is found on your Desktop, and let’s assume that directory is called LambdaSchoolWork. You would use the `/` forward slash and simply type out the name of the nested directory found within Desktop.

Run the root flag to get back to your root directory:

    cd ~

Now run:

    cd Desktop/LambdaSchoolWork

You probably got yourself an error. That’s because the directory we’re trying to move into is not created yet. But there is a way we can create a directory using the command line.

#### Learn to demonstrate their ability to use the Lambda School Git Workflow to submit an assignment to your Team Lead

At Lambda School we’re doing everything we can to get you to practice what it’s like to work in a real-world environment. This git/GitHub workflow will expose you to various ways that companies commonly use git to collaborate on their software.

##### Overview

### The Lambda School Git Flow

The Lambda School Git Flow is how you will access and submit all of your projects from this point forward. Using what you’ve learned so far about git and the command line you will be able to fork a repo, clone it to your local machine, work on the project, then create a pull request for submission.

### Why would you learn _this_ flow?

You will work in a specific environment when you go out and get a job as a software developer. Learning a broad approach to different git strategies will help you thrive in any specific environment. By learning this flow, you will become a master of both forking and branching, common strategies in “the real world”.

Also, here at Lambda School, we have hundreds of students working with dozens of TLs every day. This flow will help you all collaborate on your work together. This flow also gives us a more firm understanding of where you’re at with your skills and abilities as you continue to progress.

### Best Practices

Implicit in this flow are some best practices that you should always follow.

#### Branching

You should delete branches when you’re done using them. Similarly, you should never work on a branch for more than a few continuous days, always break a project down into lots and lots of smaller branches, and push and pull often. This will save you work when it comes to merge conflicts working with lots of developers later on.

#### Commenting

When you write code, you should get in the habit of adding meaningful comments to your code explaining why you wrote what you wrote. For the next four units, it will mostly just be you working on your code, so it can be tempting to skip this step, but it’s really important to get into good habits early in your career, because this can set you apart as a developer who can clearly communicate.

#### Committing

Developers like git because it is a version control system. Inherit to git is the idea that you never lose any progress! Gone are the days of pulling your hair out at 2am looking for v1 or v2 files that you maybe emailed to someone else, they’re all saved in the version history. As such, there are a few best practices that you may have used with, for example, word documents that don’t translate.

First of all, keeping old content is totally unnecessary. If you ever need to refer to content from a previous version, you can do so by looking at version history.

Second, you need to commit often and use meaningful commit messages. In order to go back and look at an old version of your code, you’ll need to know which specific commit you want to look at. That means a commit message like “deleted unnecessary assets from images folder” will be a lot more helpful than something vague like “styling updates”.

With all that, let’s move on to what really matters, the Lambda git flow!

##### Follow Along

### Git-Flow-Practice

The following is taken from [this repository on GitHub](https://github.com/LambdaSchool/Git-Flow-Practice)

This project is designed for you to practice the Git/Github workflow here at Lambda School. You will use this assignment to demonstrate your ability to work within this flow. Follow along with the instructions listed below to complete the assignment.

### Directions to complete this assignment

### Theses are the steps that you will be doing DAILY for your projects here at Lambda school.

**Step 1:** Create YOUR OWN version of Repo —> (Fork)

![Fork_LI](https://tk-assets.lambdaschool.com/883ddcb8-be8f-46f0-bc63-5f3b2a64aee7_Fork_LI1.jpg)

Click the Fork Button to fork the Repo

**Step 2:** Your name should now be in front of the repo name before the slash ‘/’ if forking is successful

![Add TL](https://tk-assets.lambdaschool.com/1f7aa628-8027-4613-a933-f476a4983773_screencapture-github-MileyWright-Git-for-Web-Development-Project-2019-12-01-00_24_107.png)

Notice it says ‘forked from’ and then has a link to the original Repo.

**Step 3:** Add your TL as a collaborator on your forked Repo.

- **\*\*Settings\*\*** → **\*\*Collaborators\*\*** → **\*\*Add Collaborator\*\*** (use my Github handle)

![Collab 1](https://tk-assets.lambdaschool.com/83c7b452-c8ed-4bc0-8dab-dbe89626c2a2_screencapture-github-MileyWright-Git-for-Web-Development-Project-2019-12-01-00_24_106.png)

Click Settings

![Collab 2](https://tk-assets.lambdaschool.com/edc0d84b-fae1-4f57-be50-ae481dde739d_screencapture-github-MileyWright-Git-for-Web-Development-Project-settings-2019-12-01-00_25_221.png)

Add then click the Collaborators button

![Collab 3](https://tk-assets.lambdaschool.com/fa8f1322-3bcc-458a-8a52-0356b0c9cea0_screencapture-github-MileyWright-Git-for-Web-Development-Project-settings-collaboration-2019-12-01-00_26_451.png)

Here you can enter a github user handle (the TLs handle) and add them as a collaborator

**Step 4:** Clone your Repo using GitHubs ‘Clone or download’ button

![Clone or Download](https://tk-assets.lambdaschool.com/e6bf2daa-8a82-4b25-bc28-e34077ccaaff_screencapture-github-MileyWright-Git-for-Web-Development-Project-2019-12-01-00_24_105.png)

Click the button

![button](https://tk-assets.lambdaschool.com/a05cb31c-ccd5-4382-9f5a-1c744d5ab5af_screencapture-github-MileyWright-Git-for-Web-Development-Project-2019-12-02-00_24_321.png)

Here you can either highlight the link and copy the text OR click Clipboard icon on the right and that will copy the link as well.

**Step 5:** Back inside your CLI, use the **\*\*cd**\*\* command to go to the directory where you are going to want to clone your forked Repo (i.e. The location where the repo should be saved on your computer)

![cd to directory](https://tk-assets.lambdaschool.com/b109931d-44f6-418f-883b-b9d1efaf8577_Untitled110.png)

Notice we are in the directory **\*\*Documents/Git**\*\*, this could be different for you depending on where you want your repo to be cloned to.

**Step 6:** Use the \*\*\*\*git clone \*\*\*\* command to clone the repo to the directory you are currently in.

![git clone](https://tk-assets.lambdaschool.com/91e7eaad-ae52-4fa8-9426-56af2a3fbbd1_Untitled19.png)

**Step 7:** **\*\*cd**\*\* into the newly created repo using the \*\*\*\*cd \*\*\*\* command

![cd into repo](https://tk-assets.lambdaschool.com/915f6d16-d5f4-44e4-82ae-4ca908fe2ffb_Untitled18.png)

**Step 8:** Use the **\*\*git checkout -b ‘firstname-lastname’**\*\* command to create your own branch name for the repo (this is the branch that you will be doing your work on)

![git checkout](https://tk-assets.lambdaschool.com/6cffb79d-4984-444d-8161-43a4a255aeef_Untitled15.png)

![git confirmation](https://tk-assets.lambdaschool.com/9de86440-8fb8-4f1a-8f45-78cb6180023f_Untitled17.png)

notice that after you checkout the branch name changes from **\*\*master**\*\* to **\*\*Miley-Wright**\*\* (or, whatever your name is)!

**Step 9:** Now you can work on your repo and start getting the project assignment done.

**Step 10:** To add and commit changes on your branch you can do the following

- **\*\*git add .**\*\* will add the repo changes and make them ready for committing

- **\*\*git commit -m “Your helpful commit message here”**\*\* will commit the changes with your specified commit message (commit message should explain what changes you’ve added to the repo that you are committing)

**Step 11:** Push your changes back up to your Github repo

- **\*\*git push -u origin branch-name**\*\* will push all of your commits from your local machine up onto github

- Remember that **\*\*branch-name**\*\* here will be whatever name you specified when you did **\*\*git checkout -b**\*\* (in the case it should be your firstname-lastname)

**Step 12:** Now that the changes are on github you can submit a PR (Pull Request)

**Step 13:** Go back to your forked Project repo on github (make sure you are on YOUR FORKED copy NOT the original Lambda one)

- Click on the **\*\*Branch:master**\*\* button on the left side (see picture)

![Branch Master](https://tk-assets.lambdaschool.com/71ebb334-bcb9-44a6-a055-b4d1eb5d01c3_screencapture-github-MileyWright-Git-for-Web-Development-Project-2019-12-01-00_24_104.png)

- This will create a dropdown where you should be able to select your name-branch now

- Click your name-branch and then click the **\*\*New pull request**\*\* button to make a pull request on your name branch

![New Pull Request](https://tk-assets.lambdaschool.com/9888f606-8729-4d06-96ae-ba26255188cc_screencapture-github-MileyWright-Git-for-Web-Development-Project-tree-Miley-Wright-2019-12-02-01_39_48.png)

- After you click new pull request it should redirect you to the pull request page

- IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU DO NOT CLICK THE **\*\*Create pull request**\*\* BUTTON UNTIL AFTER YOU’VE COMPLETED THE NEXT STEP

![Create Pull Request](https://tk-assets.lambdaschool.com/69335f91-34e9-494c-8a08-5d158298edf2_screencapture-github-LambdaSchool-Git-for-Web-Development-Project-compare-master-MileyWright-Miley-Wright-2019-12-02-01_46_10.png)

- When you get to the PR page, make sure to click the dropdown button that says **\*\*base repository**\*\* and CHANGE it to be your FORKED REPO instead of the original Lambda repo (when submitting PR it will default to the original Repo this is why it needs to be changed)

![](https://tk-assets.lambdaschool.com/ec9c0472-63a0-491a-8a2e-9f07648dd735_screencapture-github-LambdaSchool-Git-for-Web-Development-Project-compare-master-MileyWright-Miley-Wright-2019-12-02-01_46_38.png)gg

After changing the base repository it should look more like this

![PR](https://tk-assets.lambdaschool.com/ede96d2e-b7b1-4e5e-9908-ebd793903a85_screencapture-github-MileyWright-Git-for-Web-Development-Project-compare-master-MileyWright-Miley-Wright-2019-12-02-01_47_06.png)

**Step 14:** Add your TL to the **\*\*Reviewers**\*\* and then submit the pull request

![Add TL](https://tk-assets.lambdaschool.com/95ff2130-eb30-4096-a246-9ebc21ebf88a_screencapture-github-MileyWright-Git-for-Web-Development-Project-compare-master-MileyWright-Miley-Wright-2019-12-02-01_48_27.png)

**Step 15:** DO NOT MERGE YOUR OWN PULL REQUEST

![Don't merge](https://tk-assets.lambdaschool.com/0253c1eb-a941-4d6a-8fba-e34b25ab03ef_screencapture-github-MileyWright-Git-for-Web-Development-Project-pull-2-2019-12-02-07_55_16.png)

Your TL will merge the PR after they have done a review.

- **[Git for Web Development for WebPT22 w/Nathan Braun](https://youtu.be/gPUzjC99I5I)**

  Git is a distributed version control system. What does that mean to a new web developer? It means that git is used to monitor and control code changes made during development across several people or teams. Git can be overwhelming at first, but if we break it down concept by concept, it should start to become clear why almost everyone in the industry uses it every day.
