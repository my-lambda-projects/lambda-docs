                      Lambda Launch material is now updated and available in
                      Canvas. As of August, all material shown in Training Kit
                      is deprecated. Schoolâs goal is to find untapped or
                      underutilized talent, and train that talent for the most
                      in-demand jobs in the world. This module will cover our
                      careers curriculum, labs, Lambda X and the endorsement
                      process.

                    Testing will happen. The choice you make is who does the

                  Lambda School is investing in you and your success is our
                  success. We want you to succeed and have an amazing job offer

                <h5>Overview</h5>
                <p>
                  We are constantly learning and changing our curriculum to be
                  sure you have the skills that employers are looking for. The
                  technical skills are actually the easier part to teach and
                  learn. They are very concrete and you either know them or you
                  donât. It is the career skills and people âsoftâ skills that
                  can be the more difficult to teach. Soft skills like good
                  interpersonal communication, self-awareness and emotional
                  intelligence are part of who a person is, but they can still
                  be taught and improved upon. Career skill expectations are
                  always changing and an interview at a tech company is going to
                  be very different than a minimum wage job interview. At Lambda
                  school we are going to focus on âsoftâ skills and career
                  skills from the first day.

                <p>
                  Each week there is a careers lesson presented. These lessons
                  cover a wide variety of topics including job search skills,
                  presentation skills, social media presence and financial
                  planning to name just a few. These are the necessary skills to
                  help you land a great job. The career lessons also have a
                  required assignment component and you are expected to complete
                  these along with your technical assignments.

                  Lambda. Lambda X gives students the real-world knowledge,
                  training, an assigned team, and product specifications to
                  simulate what their life will be like as a developer or data

                <p>
                  The fourth sprint in every unit is a build week. In a build
                  week you spend a week on building a real-world based project
                  based on what you have learned. You will come together with
                  students from all the other tracks and with varying levels of
                  experience. You will be assigned a role and tasks based on
                  your track and experience. By the last day of build week you
                  will have a MVP (minimally viable product) to share. You can
                  even apply and be chosen to present your teams product to the
                  entire school.

                <p>
                  You will have 8 sprints in Labs that occurs between your core
                  curriculum and additional curriculum. In labs you will have
                  longer to work on a project and receive targeted lessons on
                  teamwork. This product will be one of the core pieces of your
                  portfolio. The experience working long term with a diverse
                  team will give you the experience you need to be successful at
                  your first job.

                  Includes job sourcing, applications, interview practice,

                  projects to add to your portfolio and stay sharp. Students who
                  donât continue coding after graduation are only 20% as likely

                  to crush it on the job. Endorsed Lambda students didnât just
                  make it to the end of an online course, they showed up day in
                  and day out, learning and proving mastery across a wide range
                  of technical, career, and collaborative skills. Lambda
                  Endorsement is our guarantee to you as the student that youâre
                  ready to land a great job in the industry, and our guarantee
                  to hiring managers that youâve nailed every expectation they
                  could have for you. In addition to proving to yourself and to
                  hiring managers that youâve graduated from Lambda School, here
                  are a few more benefits to getting endorsed.

                <h5>Overview</h5>
                <p>
                  Lambda Endorsement is our signal to students and employers
                  that a student is career ready. Endorsement signifies that a
                  student has not only met/exceeded all technical expectations
                  of the Lambda School curriculum, but also that they have
                  demonstrated a strong ability to work with peers and drive
                  their job search and career development.
                </p>
                <p>
                  At Lambda School Endorsement = Graduationâ¦ Graduation =
                  Endorsement.

                <p>
                  To keep Students on track towards full endorsement, there are
                  multiple checkpoints and milestones during each unit. To
                  receive an endorsement, all Students will need to
                  meet/complete the following technical and professional
                  endorsement categories
                </p>

                  2) Complete each Build Week assessment with a 2+ on each
                  objective 3) Complete a Technical Endorsement Review:

                <p>
                  Once a Student completes the Lambda School coursework, a
                  member of the Careers team will review and sign off on the
                  following:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Resume</li>
                  <li>LinkedIn</li>
                  <li>GitHub (Web, iOS, AND, DS tracks only)</li>
                  <li>Portfolio and artifacts for the Studentâs track</li>
                  <li>1:1 behavioral interview</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  Students can find detailed expectations and requirements,
                  along with checklists to complete all of the above:

                </p>
                <p>
                  Each of the above endorsement categories will be evaluated as
                  a Student moves through Lambdaâs curriculum. If a Student
                  needs additional time to work on any of the endorsement
                  categories, weâll work with them during Lambda X to help them
                  get Lambda Endorsed and career-ready.

                  There is a team of curriculum developers at Lambda School that
                  work on the training kit content, guided project lesson plans,
                  module projects, sprint projects and assessments. With as
                  quickly as technical subjects change, they are tasked with
                  updating content continuously. The curriculum developer works
                  in conjunction with a subject matter expert and instructors to
                  ensure that the curriculum is techically correct and teaches
                  the necessary concepts.

                  At Lambda, we have the unique opportunity to work closely with
                  hiring partners and industry experts when designing every
                  component of our curriculum.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The very first step when starting to design curriculum, is to
                  work with these partners to develop the learning objectives.
                  We get to ask ourselves about the specific skills a student
                  must have to be hired in their chosen track. What must they
                  understand? What attitudes and dispositions must they possess?
                </p>
                <p>
                  Once we have this large list of objectives, we can work
                  backwards from there to design our modules, module projects,
                  sprints, sprint challenges, units, and build week projects.
                  This ensures that we engineer every moment of a studentâs
                  Lambda journey with the most important outcome in mind:
                  getting the student a job!
