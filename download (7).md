# Intro CSS

<span class="lead"> </span>

In this module we will dive deeper into the world of CSS to learn about the box model, specificity, and responsive units. These tools will help you to write professional-quality CSS that will be mostly compatible across browser types and screen sizes.

**At the end of this module, you should be able to:**

- learn about the box model and be able to explain its properties
- demonstrate CSS specificity and inheritance to create and update styles
- implement a CSS reset and understand why it’s important for cross browser development
- describe and use responsive units to create a fully responsive website

#### Pro Tip

Keep in mind that anything you put on social media reflects your brand. Consider what is important for you to say and for other people to hear you say, and use this to shape a social media presence that is both professional and authentic to you.

#### Learn to learn about the box model and be able to explain its properties

##### Overview

### Introduction to the Box Model

The box model places all html elements into boxes. The make-up of each box is the content (text or image), padding (blank space around the content), border, and margin (blank space around the border). We use CSS to add style in our box model. By default, most html elements are boxes - however, there are some, including `<span>`, `<a>`, `<button>`, and others, that don’t follow these rules. These can be modified to follow the box model in CSS with `display: block`

![Image of the box model](https://i.imgur.com/jZrYyQV.gif)

- `height` and `width`

  - We can tell the browser exactly how wide and how tall we want our element (content) to be. This is used in `div`s, `img`s, and other height-based elements (in order to determine the size of text, we will need to use a different styling property). Size values can be in lots of different measures, but the most common are the pixel (“px”) and relative percent of screen (%).

  div {
  height: 400px;
  width: 400px;
  }

      div {
      height: 100%;
      width: auto;

  }

- `margin`
  - The margin is an invisible area that surrounds your content, padding, and border. This is the outermost area in the box model.
- `border`

  - Border will set a border around your element. You can determine the size, color, and style of the border. It will be set up in this order: width, style, color (a list of border styles can be found [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border). The border is outside the padding, but inside the margin.

  div {
  border: 1px solid black;
  }

- `padding`
  - The padding is the transparent area between the border and the content. It is very similar to the margin.

See the Pen [Precourse Box Model](https://codepen.io/lambdaschool/pen/6e4b0e0e1fe78c145cdbd47e92b05a88) by Lambda School ([@lambdaschool](https://codepen.io/lambdaschool)) on [CodePen](https://codepen.io).

**Check for Understanding:** Play with the CSS above to change the border and padding around the h1 content.

##### Follow Along

Hopefully you’re starting to make connections between this material and its application on our Lambda School clone. When we left off, our whole webpage was squished down to its bare bones. Let’s add some CSS to reflect learnings about the box model.

See the Pen [Objective 2 - Box Model](https://codepen.io/lambdaschool/pen/0ff4f6ef935cbcef04f4ea49d796b4db) by Lambda School ([@lambdaschool](https://codepen.io/lambdaschool)) on [CodePen](https://codepen.io).

We can start small by adding styling to the button such that it looks like lambdaschool.com.

    button {
      color: white;
      font-family: sans-serif;
      font-size: 16px;
      background-color: #BB2026;
      border: 0px;
      padding: 10px;
    }

Let’s add padding to the #image-container as well.

    #image-container {
      background: url("https://assets-global.website-files.com/5cd091cfb5499f22bdf72905/5d1133da829994859a190d12_website-home4.jpg");
      padding: 200px;
      background-position: center;
    }

Finally, let’s change the width of our text so that it cuts off right around this smiling student’s shoulder. To do that, we’re going to cheat a little and use a responsive design trick that you’ll learn later on. Instead of sizing our #home-page-text div with pixels, we’re going to use a percentage so that no matter what width the page is, the text always looks right.

    h1, h2, p {
      color: black;
      font-family: sans-serif;
      width: 50%;
    }

We’re not going to build the whole website here, but with some research, at this point you could add a navigation menu, place an “apply now” button in the corner, and even challenge yourself to create the Tweet slideshow down below! We’ll revisit this page at the end of our JavaScript curriculum. But for now, sit back, and get excited about the power of frontend!

##### Challenge

Continue to add style to your personal webpage with the box model where applicable. If you haven’t added an image yet, now is a good time to do so and practice styling.

#### Learn to demonstrate CSS specificity and inheritance to create and update styles

The most basic building blocks of any app or website on the internet today rely heavily on HTML and CSS. The first steps into building bigger and more complex projects start with a solid understanding of CSS specificity and inheritance.

##### Overview

#### CSS Inheritance

CSS stands for cascading style sheets. To understand CSS, we need to understand where the “C” comes from. The word “cascade” suggests a pattern of inheritance that we can use in our code. Inheritance in computer science is similar to inheritance in humans - characteristics are passed down from generation to generation. Children inherit characteristics and personality traits from their parents.

CSS inheritance is similar to human inheritance in that you can pass traits down to ancestor elements. In CSS, every ancestor of the original parent gains access to all the CSS properties through inheritance. You may be thinking, “How does inheritance occur in CSS?” The answer is the HTML structure. In HTML, when an element is placed inside another element, it is said to be nested within its parent element. This HTML nesting creates a bond between elements that we call inheritance.

Lets look at an example to demonstrate inheritance:

**HTML Structure:**

    <div class="parent">
      <p>Parent</p>
      <div class="child">
        <p>Child</p>
        <div class="grandchild">
          <p>Grandchild</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

**CSS:**

    .parent {
      color: red;
    }

Notice that by styling the `.parent` class, all of our `p` tags nested inside of the parent class turn red. Using inheritance this way is extremely powerful and allows for more natural development when building user interfaces. However, we don’t always want to change everything at once. What if we only wanted two elements to turn red and not all 3? This problem can be solved with specificity and understanding selectors.

### CSS Specificity

Specificity is the concept we use to describe the ability to style many elements or just one element using CSS selectors. Selectors allow us to access HTML tags and update their styles. Before we learn more about selector syntax and usage, we need to study specificity weight.

##### Specificity Weight

Think of specificity weight like the waterfall example used earlier. The water at the top of the waterfall is less specific and, therefore, can be overwritten further This diagram below helps visualize specificity weight. Note the `<` symbol is used to represent “less specific.” The more you read to the right, the more specific a selector or style will be. You have seen some of the selectors in this list before, others might be new.

    * < elements < classes, pseudo-classes, attributes < IDs < inline styles < !important

The selectors above are very common in styling practices, but they do not represent every possible selector. It is recommended that you solidify your knowledge of these selectors first before moving on to more advanced selectors. A few of those are below.

#### Universal Selector `*`

There are occasions you would want to select every element on a web page. The universal selector, sometimes called the wild card or star selector, does precisely that.

**Specificity Weight:** Less specific than any selector.

##### CSS Syntax example:

    * {
      color: red;
    }

#### Element Selectors `<h1></h1>`

When styling elements, we are basically telling the browser: “I want every single tag I specify to follow my styles.” This is more specific than the universal selector.

**Specificity Weight:** More specific than universal less than everything else.

##### HTML Syntax example:

    <h1>I'm a h1 element</h1>

##### CSS Syntax example:

    h1 {
      color: blue;
    }

#### Class Selector `.class`

Class selectors begin to introduce a heavier specificity compared to the element or universal selectors. Classes allow us to select individual elements by placing a special attribute in our HTML. We can use the same class over and over again on many elements. This behavior is extremely powerful and allows designers and developers to be more efficient.

**Specificity Weight:** More than universal and element, less than ID, inline, and important.

##### HTML Syntax example:

    <h1 class="example-class">I'm a class</h1>
    <h1 class="example-class">I'm a duplicate class</h1>
    <div class="another-class">New class selector</div>

##### CSS Syntax example:

    .example-class {
      color: green;
      font-size: 16rem;
      text-align: center;
    }

#### Multiple Classes

Classes are unique in that we can have multiple classes in the same HTML attribute. This allows for layers of class specificity weight that we can control by using sibling selectors. The example below demonstrates how this might look.

**Specificity Weight:** Same overall weight as a single class, but lowest class on the page wins.

#### Pseudo-Classes

Pseudo-classes are used when you may not have a set amount of elements, but you still want to style them individually.

For example, you are given a list of items in a store’s inventory. That list of items grows and shrinks everyday with purchases and new items.

Now let’s imagine that the last item in the inventory needs to update to a new color to signify the end of the inventory. Without pseudo-classes, we couldn’t achieve that result.

We could use something like `li:last-child` to always select the last child in an unordered list to achieve our goal with the inventory.

**Specificity Weight:**

Same specificity weight as classes. More specific than universal and element.  
Less specific than ID, inline styles, and important.

##### HTML Syntax example:

    <h1 class="normal">Normal class here</h1>
    <h1 class="normal">Normal class here</h1>
    <h1 class="normal">Psuedo class found here!</h1>

##### CSS Syntax example:

    h1:last-child {
      color: orange;
    }

#### ID Selectors

IDs are only allowed to be used once per HTML page. Use IDs for very specific reasons that can’t be accomplished using a class. Be mindful of where you use IDs as their specificity weight is heavier than most selectors.

##### Specificity Weight:

- More than universal, element, pseudo-classes, and classes.
- Less than inline styles, and important.

##### HTML Syntax example:

    <h1 id="example-id">I have an ID</h1>

##### CSS Syntax example:

    #example-id {
      color: gold;
    }

#### 3 Different Style Integrations

You can introduce CSS styles into your HTML using 3 different approaches.

1.  Inline styles
2.  Embedded style tag in the HTML page
3.  Externally linked CSS file

The standards the best approach change with the flow of new technology, but for now, we will say that external style sheets are the way to code. Why? Because both the inline styles and the style tag are more specific, and we want to control all our style specificity in one place as we learn. In the future, you may have cases where knowledge of all three come into play. It is generally recommended to know how all three work. We recommend the [overview from w3 schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_howto.asp) if you want to dig in.

### Specificity Tutorial

For this tutorial, you will be building CSS selector chains to demonstrate specificity and inheritance.

CSS specificity begins with HTML structure. Before we write any CSS, study the HTML nesting below:

    <div class="container">
      <header>
        <h1 class="main-header">Lambda School</h1>
        <nav>
          <a href="#">Tracks</a>
          <a href="#">About</a>
          <a href="#">Blog</a>
          <a href="#">Apply Now</a>
        </nav>
      </header>
    </div>

We can see that there is a class of `.container` wrapping all of the other elements.

### CSS Specificity: Many Elements

With this knowledge in hand, we now have a starting point for our specificity chain to begin. Let’s start by styling the `.container` itself:

    .container {
      width: 600px;
      margin: 0 auto;
    }

Notice that all of the content within `.container` is now centered on the page. We are using the cascade to impact all of the elements inside of `container` with just a few simple lines of CSS!

Let’s increase our specificity chain by styling everything in the header to have a `font-family` of `Helvetica`:

    .container header {
      font-family: 'Helvetica', Arial, sans-serif;
    }

Because of the cascade, all of the elements in the header will now have a `font-family` of `Helvetica`.

### CSS Specificity: One Element

Styling many elements is pretty easy because of the cascade, what about styling one specific element?

Let’s select the `.main-header` class and style it’s `color` to `crimson`:

    .container header .main-header {
      color: crimson;
    }

Note that we could have written the selector chain above with just the `h1` and achieved the same result:

    .container header h1 {
      color: crimson;
    }

This is because both the class `.main-header` and the `h1` element is on the same specificity level in our chain.

If we wanted to be extremely specific, we could use both the element AND the class together like this:

    .container header h1.main-header {
      color: crimson;
    }

We just did the same thing in three different ways with the same result!

Some developers see this as a powerful aspect of CSS; but, others point this out as a reason CSS is so confusing.

Our opinion is that you should know several ways to do the same thing in case you run into a unique situation where you need to weigh the specificity more heavily.

At this point, you should attempt to style the anchor tags inside the navigation, explore the several different ways you could write your specificity chains.

#### Learn to implement a CSS reset and understand why it’s important for cross browser development

CSS resets allow development teams to have a consistent rendering experience across multiple browsers. Resets are common in the web development industry and although they may not be right every situation, knowing about them and how they are used it critical to most projects.

##### Overview

### What is a CSS Reset?

A CSS reset is when a developer will remove all default styling provided by browsers. Usually, a CSS reset will set all box model and font properties to 0 or inherit.

Example code from Eric Meyer’s popular CSS reset:

    html, body, div, span, applet, object, iframe,
    h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, p, blockquote, pre,
    a, abbr, acronym, address, big, cite, code,
    del, dfn, em, img, ins, kbd, q, s, samp,
    small, strike, strong, sub, sup, tt, var,
    b, u, i, center,
    dl, dt, dd, ol, ul, li,
    fieldset, form, label, legend,
    table, caption, tbody, tfoot, thead, tr, th, td,
    article, aside, canvas, details, embed,
    figure, figcaption, footer, header, hgroup,
    menu, nav, output, ruby, section, summary,
    time, mark, audio, video {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    border: 0;
    font-size: 100%;
    font: inherit;
    vertical-align: baseline;
    }

This type of reset is beginner-friendly because it forces you to create your own styles from scratch.

### Alternative Resets

There are other more tailored resets that companies will use that are very specific to their needs. Some companies will incorporate their own style guides into a reset so that all new developers joining the company are aligned from the beginning.

A popular alternative to just setting everything to zero is called Normalize. Normalize focuses on only fixing the cross browser problems and adding your own styles. The focus here is to utilize the positive sides of default browser styles. If you would like to learn more about normalize it would be to your advantage as many companies use this to build their projects.

Link to normalize: https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/

### Implementation

Because resets knock out most default styling from the browser, you will want to place your reset code at the top of your CSS page. If you put the reset at the bottom of your page, it will knock out all your styles due the cascade of CSS.

If you choose to use a CSS reset, make it your first priority to use it at the top of your CSS files when starting a project, otherwise it will be more of a headache than a help.

### CSS Reset In Action

The best way to see a reset in action is to use existing code with default settings in it. Then, add a reset to see the difference. Follow these instructions to see how impactful a reset it:

- Open this codepen: https://codepen.io/lambdaschool/pen/bjWbrx?editors=1000
- Go to Eric Meyer’s reset page: https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/
- Copy and paste the CSS reset code
- Paste the code in the CSS section of the codepen you have open
- Observe the huge changes that just occurred

Notice how your code is now looking lifeless. This is pretty jarring at first, but it gives us an opportunity now style these tags the way the designer wants without being worried about cross browser issues.

### See The Difference: Reset vs Normalize

Use this codepen: https://codepen.io/lambdaschool/pen/bjWbrx?editors=1000

Implement the eric meyer reset and take note of how much changed. Then implement normalize instead of the eric meyer reset. Notice the subtle but important differences. Make a list of changes you see between the two approaches by inspecting the code in your web developer tools and looking at the CSS properties on each element.

#### Learn to describe and use responsive units to create a fully responsive website

Responsive units allow us the flexibility we need to code for thousands of devices in one code base.

##### Overview

### px

The `px` unit is referred to as an `absolute length unit`. This means that `px` does not adjust for its surroundings. That being understood, `px` units are still viable in some scenarios where layout control is needed. Modern browsers now allow `px` units to scale with the zoomed in viewport.

#### Syntax Example

    <h1>Example</h1>

    h1 {
      font-size: 18px;
    }

#### Pros

- Easiest unit for developers to read from design files
- Modern browsers now allow `px` units to grow with built in zoom features
- No reliance on cascade for sizing

#### Cons

- Rigid unit that is not responsive in layouts
- Hard coded font size values are not accessible for users that change their default settings

### em

The `em` unit is referred to as a `relative length unit`. This means that `em` will adjust to its surroundings. In the syntax example below you can see that the `h1` is nested within the `.main-content` section.

Notice that the `.main-content` has a `font-size: 10px`. The `em` inside of our `h1` will now adjust its value to match the `10px`! This can be really useful when building responsive layouts or adjusting fonts on different devices.

One of the issues with `em` is its inherited calculation. Sometimes changing just one parent element can lead to a cascade of skewed sizes. The cascade of font sizes can easily compound, creating hard-to-anticipate issues.

#### Syntax Example

    <section class="main-content">
      <h1>Example</h1>
    </section>

    .main-content {
      font-size: 10px;
    }

    .main-content h1 {
      /* 2em === 20px */
      font-size: 2em;
    }

#### Pros

- Responsive to its surroundings

#### Cons

- Can be too flexible at times and create cascading font sizes that weren’t expected
- Converting `px` to `em` when creating code from a design file usually requires a calculator or memorization that can feel cumbersome

### rem

The `rem` or `root em` unit is also referred to as a `relative length unit`. The `root` part means that this unit looks to the `root` element in a page. Usually the `root` element is going to be the `html` tag in a web page or application.

Look at the syntax example below and you will see we have the same exact set up from our `em` example. This time we have added a reference to the `html` element and assigned a `font-size:16px`.

Notice that the `rem` in our `h1` is not impacted by our `main-content` class anymore! The `h1` is instead going off of `16px` as it’s base multiplier.

This is a great thing because now we can adjust our relative font-size off of one place instead of many like the `em` does.

**Pro Tip:** Using a hard coded pixel on the `html` tag is bad practice as it overwrites the user’s default settings on their browser.

Instead, use a % based unit to be more accessible. A great trick is to use `62.5%` as the base value because then you can convert `rem` units by the power of `10` instead of `16`. `62.5 * .16 = 10`. That means `1rem` would equate to `10px` throughout the document!

This makes using `rem` so much easier to calculate compared to `em`.

Take a look at these examples:  
`18px === 1.8rem 13px === 1.3rem 27px === 2.7rem`

#### Syntax Example

    <section class="main-content">
      <h1>Example</h1>
    </section>

    html {
      /* This technically works but is too rigid and not accessible */
      font-size: 16px;
      /* Best Practice */
      font-size: 62.5%;
    }

    .main-content {
      font-size: 10px;
    }

    .main-content h1 {
      /* 2rem === 20px */
      font-size: 2rem;
    }

#### Pros

- Responsive to `root` element only
- If you use a % based unit, you can achieve accessibility gains and eliminate the awkward conversion system of 16px (the browser’s default font-size)

#### Cons

- If you don’t make the root element flexible, you will hurt accessibility by overwriting default user settings in the browser
- Converting `px` to `rem` when creating code from a design file usually requires a calculator or memorization that can feel cumbersome

### %

The `%` unit is also referred to as a `relative length unit`. The `%` unit is usually used for building responsive layouts more than for font sizing. `%` based layouts start at the viewport width and then cascade down through nested units.

Look at the example below to see how the cascade of nested `%` based units work. You can see the `.main-content` section is `100%` of it’s viewport as it’s the top level element in our example.

Note the `h1` width is 50% of the `.main-content` width and not the viewport. That means if we adjusted `.main-content` width to a different value like 60%, the `h1` width would then become 50% of the new value 60%.

You can see how this would compound very quickly! You need to make sure that you avoid going over 100% in a responsive layout or you will get strange and frustrating behavior as you’re building.

#### Syntax Example

    <section class="main-content">
      <h1>Example</h1>
    </section>

    .main-content {
    /* this will be the entire viewport */
      width: 100%;
    }

    .main-content h1 {
    /* this will be half of .main-content */
      width: 50%;
    }

#### Pros

- Responsiveness starts at the viewport level and cascades down to nested elements helping you build layouts to adjust to any size

#### Cons

- You have to be careful with `%` based layout as widths can get too small very fast
- If you don’t add everything up to 100% when building layout, `%` can cause a lot of frustration searching the box model to see where the math went wrong

### vw / vh

These units completely rely on the viewport of the browser window to render. While these units can be used most places any other unit can be used, we caution against using them **except** in a specific use-case: full screen layouts.

If you have ever tried to use `height: 100%`, you’ll appreciate `vw` and `vh`. Rarely they are used to make a font fill the screen (think slideshows, or landing page headers w/ font sized to 1/3 of viewport, e.g. `font-size: 33vh`.)

### Other Units

There are many other absolute and responsive units. You can take a look at them here: <https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_units.asp>

Currently the most popular units of length in CSS are `rem, em, px, %` with some newer units making waves like `vw and vh`. You are encouraged to try out other units and see how they behave compared the units we have discussed here.
