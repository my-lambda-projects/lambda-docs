# JavaScript I

<span class="lead"> </span>

JavaScript I will expose you to some deeper concepts based on some of the things you already have learned during the pre course material. As we dive a bit deeper, you’ll gain a better understanding of the fundamentals of the JavaScript programming language. The concepts that you already know about are.

- Variables
- Arrays
- Objects
- Functions

This particular module is designed to go quite a bit deeper into these subjects. We will also be covering these concepts quite rapidly, but each concept lends itself to the next, so you get a lot of exposure while combining some or all of these points.

**At the end of this module, you should be able to:**

- use function declarations, expressions, and arrow functions and describe their differences
- use let, const, var and demonstrate their differences.
- create and use object literals as well as describe object properties and methods
- create and use arrays as well as array properties and array methods

#### Pro Tip

We all build on the work of others.

#### Learn to use function declarations, expressions, and arrow functions and describe their differences

Functions are everywhere in JavaScript. Being able to decipher between function syntax, concepts, and usage is vital to your success as a developer. As you continue to push deeper into JavaScript more concepts will unlock as you gain knowledge about functions.

##### Overview

### Functions

Functions are the foundation for all web interactions. Being able to execute code when you want is truly powerful in programming. Let’s define a basic function called a `function declaration` and identify the syntax.

#### Basic Function Syntax

Function declarations are made up of several syntactical parts:

- The `function` keyword
- The name of the function
- An optional list of parameters
- The statements inside the block of code `{}`

Take a look at the example below to see how all the different parts of a function declaration work together.

    // Define our function declaration
    function add(a,b){
     return a + b;
    }

If you tried to run that code on a website, you wouldn’t see anything happen. That is because you need to call a function for the execution to occur. The concept of calling a function is often called `invoking a function`.

Let’s invoke the function above to see the difference:

    // Define our function declaration
    function add(a,b){
     return a + b;
    }
    // Invoke the function add
    console.log(add(2,4)) // 6

_Note that because we are using a `return` statement in our function, we must wrap the invocation in a `console.log()` if we want to see a result in our `web console`._

#### Function Invocation, Arguments, and Parameters

When we invoke a function, we often pass in values along as well. These values are known as `arguments`. In the example above, our `arguments` are the numbers `2` and `4`.

The function receives those arguments as parameters, `a` and `b,`_in the order they were called._

This distinction trips up many new developers. It is worth repeating: _`arguments` are values that are passed into functions that receive them as `parameters`._

The name of the parameter does not matter on a syntax level. _What matters the most for parameters is the order in which they pass._

#### The `return` Statement

When you see a `return` in a block of code within a function, keep in mind that anything written _after_ a `return` statement will not execute. This is because the `return` statment will terminate the function after running the line of statements within it.

    function add(a,b){
     return a + b;
     // Anything after a return won't execute
     console.log('You will never see this code!');
    }
    console.log(add(2,4)) // 6

#### Function Declaration Hoisting

JavaScript utilizes a two-pass compiler when executing lines of code that we write. This means that anytime we run JavaScript in the browser, the browser will take two passes over our code. The first pass builds up references to all of our code, declaring variables and functions and the like. The second pass applies values to the references that were found, thus actually running the code.

Function declarations are defined in the first pass. The compiler is made aware of the function declaration and adds it to the top of the execution order for your code. This concept of putting a function higher in the execution order for later use is known as hoisting.

What does this mean for you? It means that function declarations can be invoked _before_ they are defined! Let’s take a look at an example:

    // This code is valid above the definition!
    console.log(add(2,4)) // 6

    function add(a,b){
     return a + b;
    }

This is odd behavior to developers new to JavaScript. It can be used as a feature or introduce bugs if not understood properly. Be aware that hoisting applies to function declarations and not function expressions or arrow functions.

### Function Expressions

Now that we have a better understanding of how basic function syntax works, we can push even further into another type of function, a function expression.

Function expressions have unique differences when compared against function declarations:

- A variable is used to store the function for later use
- Anonymous functions are used
- Function expressions are not hoisted. They can only be invoked after a definition has been placed in the execution stack.

Example of a function expression:

    const add = function(a,b){
     return a + b;
    }
    console.log(add(2,4)) // 6

Notice the function doesn’t actually have a name. This is what we refer to as anonymous functions. Because we are using a `const` named `add` we don’t need to name our function anything. We can simply execute the function when `add` is referenced by invocation.

Why do this and not use a function declaration? Because we have more control over our code now. Our function expression cannot be hoisted, so we can tell it when to do its job easier. We also gain the syntactical sugar of an anonymous function. We can place functions within functions easier without having to name them. We will discuss this in greater detail later on.

### Arrow Function Expressions

Arrow functions are fancy looking function expressions with a major feature removed, the `this` keyword. We won’t focus on why this is important right now, Instead, we will start getting used to seeing the syntax of what an arrow function looks like:

    // function expression syntax
    // const add = function(a,b) {
    //  return a + b;
    // }

    // arrow function expression syntax
    const add = (a,b) => {
     return a + b;
    }
    console.log(add(2,4)) // 6

You will notice that we removed the `function` keyword in front of our parameters and then added a `=>` token behind the parameters. This is a pretty straightforward conversion!

Syntactically, we didn’t remove much, we lost a few characters in the word `function` and gained a `=>`. However, there are many sub-rules for syntax with arrow functions. Those sub-rules can create extremely streamlined syntax. This line of code is a good example.

    // streamlined arrow syntax
    const add = (a,b) => a + b;

    console.log(add(2,4)) // 6

Wow, there are a lot of abstractions occurring there! Because we only have one return statement, we no longer are required to use the `return` keyword - because it’s implied! We also do not need our `{}` because they, too, are redundant in the rules of arrow functions.

It’s fun to see how slim we can get, but a word of caution: stick with the simple conversion first and slowly step into using other syntactical sugar approaches as you progress.

Often, developers will go too far with syntactical sugar, and the code becomes very hard to read. Arrow function expressions are great to use with array methods, for example, but may not be a great choice in a lot of other places.

#### When Not To Use Arrow Functions

There is a time and place for using an arrow function. Here is a list of times you should not be using them:

- Event handlers (Unless they are inside a class constructor!)
- Object methods
- Prototype methods
- Anytime you need to use arguments Object

---

#### Learn to use let, const, var and demonstrate their differences.

ES6 brought with it some mighty fine changes to the JavaScript language. One of the most commonly used, and easiest to start using are the new keywords for declaring variables. Understanding the pitfalls of having only `var` at your disposal, and how to combat those pitfalls with the likes of `let` and `const` will make your life so much better as a JavaScript engineer.

##### Overview

Let’s look at some in depth examples of using `var`, `let` and `const`.

    var name = 'Batman';

What we have done here is told the computer to hold a String: ‘Batman’ in memory. And if we ask the computer to retrieve that information for us, all we have to do is call for the ‘name’ variable `console.log(name);` and we should get the string ‘Batman’ printed out in the console.

This is how we capture data into memory in JavaScript. First, we declare a variable by calling `var` and deciding what that variable should be named, in this case: `name`. Then, we assign the variable (`name`) to a specific piece of data/information, in this case, the string ‘Batman’. For up to 5 standardized (over a decade of use with JavaScript), this was sufficient, one keyword `var` always got the job done.

But, because JavaScript is a dynamic language. We actually can override what the variable `name` points to in memory. This can cause issues because something like the following example is totally legal.

    var name = 'Batman';
    var name = 'Robin';
    console.log(name); --> prints 'Robin';

What this means is that you can completely override the definition of the variable, `name`. This would be a problem in large applications with many ‘global’ (we’ll talk about global and local later) variables. In these circumstances, you can easily override information that may be completely important and vital to your application if you’re not super careful.

As a result of this ability to override and replace variables almost at will, [ES6’s let keyword](http://es6-features.org/#BlockScopedVariables) gives us the ability to not only combat this problem but, to solve problems we didn’t even know we had.

One of the best abilities we gain from `let` (AND `const`) is that variables cannot be overridden without throwing an error code. `let` allows us to solve this problem.

Let’s reference the example from above:

    let name = 'Batman';
    let name = 'Robin';
    console.log(name);

I dare you to run that code in your browser’s console.

You’ll probably find something like this happening:

![Overridden Variable Syntax error](https://ibin.co/3rbugoeB30vy.png)

One thing to note is that `let` _is mutable_ (another big word alert!) -meaning we can change the value (or _thing_ that a variable points to). That may be super confusing but is demonstrated with this example:

    let name = 'Batman';
    name = 'Robin';
    console.log(name) --> 'Robin';

As you can see, the name variable has been `re-assigned` but not `overridden` by another `name` variable declared with the `let` keyword. All this means is that name now `points to` the String:’Robin’; so this is one of the major differences (if not the only difference) between `let` and `const`.

[const](http://es6-features.org/#Constants) is the most _strict_ of all keywords used to declare variables in JavaScript. Meaning, it has the most rules applied to it. `const` is a keyword that we use to declare a variable, and make it’s associated data, constant. Meaning, you can never `re-assign` what a `constant variable` points to like you can with `let` and `var`.

The major difference between `let` and `const` is that `const` is immutable, and its value can never be reassigned. So, to do something like we did above will give us our friendly little Syntax Error from above.

    const name = 'Batman';
    name = 'Robin';
    console.log(name) --> 'Robin';

To recap:

- `var` can be re-assigned and overridden.
- `let` can be re-assigned but not overridden.
- `const` cannot be re-assigned nor overridden.

Because these three keywords achieve the same thing (storing data in memory and assigning that data a ‘key’ that can be used for access) but behave very differently, there are places in this world for all three. And of course, as with everything, there are some other intricacies to learn about the `let` `const` and `var` keywords that we didn’t cover here today.

**Lambda School Rule of Thumb** When defining/declaring variables _use const until you can’t, then use let_.

I **Highly** recommend researching the differences between `var`, `let` and `const` in terms of their scoping rules as well. We’ll cover more on this later on when talking about function vs. block scoping. But for now, I’ll point you towards the `Dig Deeper` section for some the `How let and const are scoped in JavaScript` for some further understanding here.

#### Learn to create and use object literals as well as describe object properties and methods

Objects are used all over in JavaScript. In fact, without the object, we don’t have the JavaScript language. Understanding how everything we do in JavaScript is built on objects is not only crucial to your understanding of the language, you won’t be able to go very far without knowing about them.

##### Overview

### Object Literals

Let’s learn how to create an `object literal` and assign it properties/values by use of `dot notation` and `bracket` notation. Objects can give programs access to their properties.

Objects are super powerful. In fact, you may hear this a lot: `Everything in JavaScript is an object`. Objects are used throughout almost every single part of the JavaScript Programming language.

#### Object Properties

Objects in JavaScript are used as a way to store data and give the programmer access to that data when needed.

This ability to store data and call it is known as a property. Properties are organized as `key:value` pairs.

Lets look at an object literal with some properties on it:

    const myPersonalObject = {
    firstName: 'Fred',
    lastName: 'Flintstone',
    };

We have created a `myPersonalObject` and assigned some properties to it. The **keys** of `myPersonObject` are `firstName` and `lastName`. The **values** of those keys are `Fred` and `Flintstone` Respectively.

If we want to use `myPersonalObject` later on, all we have to do is reference it with either `bracket` or `dot` notation.

#### Dot Notation for referencing the `firstName` property is:

    myPersonalObject.firstName // 'Fred'

#### Bracket Notation for referencing the `firstName` property is:

    myPersonalObject["firstName"] // 'Fred'

Pay attention to the quotes around the “firstName” property. The quotes are because we’re using `brackets` around the firstName value.

If we want to change “Fred’s” first name, all we’d have to do (just like a variable) is reference what we want to change and set it `=` to something.

For example, if Fred’s name were to be changed to reflect `Wilma` all we’d have to do is select the property with either `bracket` or `dot notation`, and then set the `firstName` key to ‘Wilma’

    myPersonalObject.firstName = 'Wilma';

**NOTICE:** It’s imperative to remember that an object’s values are mutable by default. Meaning, even though `myPersonalObject` is set to a `const`, its values can be changed. This is because `myPersonalObject` is set pointing to itself as the object, but we can change the props on an object all we want.

There are a few elegant methods for handing objects. These methods can help us iterate over keys.

    Object.keys() -> Gives us an array back of the Object's properties/keys

    const keys = Object.keys(myPersonalObject);
    returns ['firstName', 'lastName'];

    Object.values() -> Gives us an array back of all the Object's values

    const values = Object.values(myPersonalObject);
    returns ['Wilma', 'Flintstone'];

    Object.entries() -> Gives us back an array of the Object's key/value pairs as a `tuple`

    const entries = Object.entries(myPersonalObject);
    returns [ [ 'firstName', 'Wilma' ], [ 'lastName', 'Flintstone' ] ]​​​​​

When dealing with objects, it is common practice to see them handled in this way.

##### Follow Along

### Create an object that tells us all about you.

This object should include:

- firstName
- lastName
- age
- homeTown
- favoriteColor

### Once you’re done creating your object, do the following:

- Return a list of the values of your object.
- Return a list of the keys of your object.
- Return a list of the entries of your object.

#### Learn to create and use arrays as well as array properties and array methods

Arrays are just a special type of object. The thing that makes arrays special is their ability to store ordered values. We gain a lot of abilities from using an array methods on our code. Let’s take a look at what an array is and how it works.

##### Overview

### Arrays

Let’s Learn about the fundamental usage of arrays in JavaScript, and how to define an array and assign it to a value.

Arrays have a special `0 based` indexing (organizational) ability. They allow us to store data in them sequential based on 0. An array under the hood might look something like this:

    array: {
    '0': 'firstValue',
    '1': 'secondValue,
    }

Even though Arrays in JavaScript are just specially treated Objects under the hood (run `console.log(typeof [])` in the chrome console to see what I mean), they behave quite a bit differently. For one, they are index-based, and ordered, whereas Objects are not ordered or sorted in any fashion.

Arrays in JavaScript are `0` index-based. Which means the first item found in an array will be found at index 0. So item 1 will be index 0, item 2 will be index 1 etc. This can be confusing, but once you get used to it, arrays become quite nice to work with.

You can access any item in an array by selecting the array, and using ‘brackets’ to choose which index you want to reference.

    const hogwarts = ['Harry', 'Hermione', 'Ron'];
    hogwarts[0] === 'Harry';
    hogwarts[1] === 'Hermionie';
    hogwarts[3] === 'Ron';

If you wanted to add a character to our hogwarts array, you could do so by using `.push()`

    hogwarts.push('Dumbledore');
    // gives us -> ['Harry', 'Hermione', 'Ron', 'Dumbledore]';

If we wanted to add something to the front of the array, we could use `.unshift()`

    hogwarts.unshift('Snape');
    // gives us -> ['Snape', 'Harry', 'Hermione', 'Ron', 'Dumbledore]';

If we wanted to remove the last item in the array. Use `.pop()`

    hogwarts.pop(); -> this will give you the item poped off the array.
    // gives us -> ['Snape', 'Harry', 'Hermione', 'Ron']';

##### Follow Along

Create an array of your favorite things. Use methods like `.push()` `.unshift()` `.splice()` to play around with your list.
