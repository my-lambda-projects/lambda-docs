# Sprint 1 - Planning a Project

<span class="lead"> </span>

Check out the guided projects, module inquiries, and sprint challenge for your first sprint in labs.

## [Guided Project: Planning](../module/rec7JPnP0pXGAP2Jo)

## Objectives

- Student can articulate breaking down a release into individual tasks.

## Resources

- 🐙 [Blank Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/aE7YSd3b/project-management)
- 🐙 [Training Kit GitHub Repo](https://github.com/LambdaSchool/labs-curriculum)
- 🐙 [Labs Student Guide](https://www.notion.so/lambdaschool/Labs-25-Student-Guide-7be23f8048ca4d2eae69a06f4613f67a)

## Schedule

Here’s an overview of our guided project schedule today:

![Planning GP Schedule](https://tk-assets.lambdaschool.com/9074e5b3-76f2-4881-81ab-e1fd36fa3beb_ScreenShot2020-07-31at3.53.17PM.png)

## Purpose

Before you can start development, you need to know what you’re developing. This requires planning and knowing what your client wants. As you begin the process of breaking down a development slate into individual tasks, you’ll be thinking in terms of user stories.

User stories are short, simple descriptions of a feature told from the user’s perspective. For example:

- “As a user, I can back up my entire hard drive.”
- “As a user, I can indicate folders not to backup so that my backup drive isn’t filled up with things I don’t need to have saved.”

## Lesson

Your instructor will accompany you through an IWY loop (I do, We do, You do) in today’s guided project. Here’s what to expect:

### _I Do_

#### Getting acquainted with user stories

- Your instructor walks you through the what, how, and why of user stories.

#### Application walkthrough

- Your instructor takes you through the AllTrails web application and asks for your participation via Slack to help identify the user stories you see.

### _We Do_

#### Exploring an application

- Your instructor will give you a list of several web applications. You’ll be given a few minutes to write down as many user stories as you can find. Take note of where you found each user story (what page, where on the page, etc.).

#### Reviewing student examples

- Your instructor pulls up a few student-sourced examples of user stories and offers feedback.

#### Breaking down a product roadmap into user stories

- Your instructor opens up Citrics product roadmap and creates Trello cards for each user story.

#### Adding supplemental tasks to user stories

- Your instructor uses the Citrics product to demonstrate how to go about breaking down a user story into a checklist of technical tasks to accomplish.

### _You Do_

#### Breaking down a single user story

- In breakout rooms, you’ll be given a user story (for example, “As a judge, I can individually score a project”). With your group, you’ll determine what technical tasks are required to perform that particular function.

#### Reviewing student examples

- Your instructor uses a few student examples of technical task breakdowns to discuss and provide feedback.

---

## After Class

Take a few minutes to review the principles you’ve learned. What questions do you still have? Remember, your instructor, TL, and Labs Support Hours are here to help. Don’t hesitate to reach out.

#### Objectives:

- Student should be able to articulate breaking down a release into individual tasks.
- Student should be able to evaluate and articulate tradeoffs for architectural, data, and design decisions
- Student should be able to extract and document product expectations from stakeholders and customers

## [Guided Project: Plan Critique](../module/recra4AWVdeHriA7K)

## Objectives

## Schedule

Here’s an overview of our guided project schedule today.

![Plan Critique GP schedule](https://tk-assets.lambdaschool.com/a2149da1-e400-412b-84ad-ab71c2216dc2_ScreenShot2020-07-31at4.18.06PM.png)

## Purpose

Everything at Lambda is engineered to prepare you for your future job. Framing your learning in the context of its application on the job or in a hiring manager interview should serve as a vital reminder of your trajectory.

Recontextualizing your user story task breakdowns as an exercise in interview prep serves as an excellent example of how we want you to reimagine the real-world relevance of all the work you do here.

## Lesson

### _I Do_

#### Review takeaways from yesterday’s guided project

- Your instructor takes a few minutes to review the key points and takeaways from our guided project on user stories and planning.

### _We Do_

#### Reviewing Trello boards

- Your instructor picks three teams and reviews their Trello boards as a group exercise.

#### Hiring manager questions

- Your instructor guides class participation via Slack in assembling a number of questions hiring managers could ask about the thinking and technical decision-making behind your task breakdown process.

#### Speaking about your process

- Your instructor and a Career Specialist use a student Trello board to create several resume power statements and conduct a mock interview:
  - “How did you break down your tasks? What aspects of the project did you have clear ownership of?”
  - “How did you divide up work to deliver on time?”
  - “What were the results or outcomes of dividing the project the way the team did? Was this process effective?”
- Your instructor conducts this interview in front of the class and the Career Specialist reiterates what makes a power statement. Your instructor may also use some student-curated questions. You’re encouraged to write your own questions based on your task breakdown.

### _You Do_

#### Going over the inquiry

- Your instructor discusses the inquiry questions and what you should focus on in the afternoon.

---

## After Class

Take a few minutes to review the principles you’ve learned. What questions do you still have? Remember, your instructor, TL, and Labs Support Hours are here to help. Don’t hesitate to reach out.

#### Objectives:

- Student should be able to articulate breaking down a release into individual tasks

## [Module Inquiry 1](../module/reca587Ou79n4JDmT)

## Questions

1.  What questions did you ask your stakeholder that helped in breaking down your tasks?
2.  What user stories did you draw from to create your product roadmap? List them below.
3.  Select your favorite user story. What are the tasks that need to be accomplished in order to ship that particular user story?
    - What did you do well in this task breakdown process? What were some challenges?
4.  After what you’ve learned in this process, given a new product roadmap, how would you approach it differently? What would you change about the way you go about breaking down individual tasks?

#### Objectives:

## [Guided Project: Engineering](../module/recYk51eKPftN24Gv)

## Objectives

- Student will be able to articulate tradeoffs for architectural and design decisions.

## Resources

## Schedule

Here’s an overview of our guided project schedule today.

![Engineering GP Schedule](https://tk-assets.lambdaschool.com/4a12aa6d-ce0a-40c3-a8e6-04d3e61a4c24_ScreenShot2020-07-31at4.22.10PM.png)

## Purpose

Architecture is a prerequisite for any product development planning.

A top-level concept of the system’s required functions is broken down into sub-functions; the most abstract version of its physical form is broken down into subsystems capable of performing the sub-functions, and so on for other types of breakdowns.

## Lesson

### _I Do_

#### What is an architecture breakdown?

- Your instructor discusses the mechanics of an architecture breakdown, its utility, and what you’ll be accomplishing.

### _We Do_

#### Reviewing product requirements

- Your instructor takes a product roadmap and reviews the product requirements with you.

#### High-level architecture diagram

- Guiding class participation via Slack, your instructor creates a component diagram and data flow diagram, incorporating your suggestions.

#### Technical details

- Your instructor walks you through the frameworks and libraries to use. Constraints, standards, site management, and scaffolding will also be discussed.

#### Data model

- Your instructor will identify models, discuss normalization, and create a database schema for the product.

### _You Do_

#### Working as a team

- Your instructor will direct you to spend time working on your architecture as a team.

---

## After Class

Take a few minutes to review the principles you’ve learned. What questions do you still have? Remember, your instructor, TL, and Labs Support Hours are here to help. Don’t hesitate to reach out.

#### Objectives:

- Student should be able to break down a release into individual tasks
- Student should be able to accurately estimate the scope or timeline of an individual task

## [Guided Project: GitHub](../module/recxvP9aTVUFLUuhk)

## Objectives

- Student can articulate the challenges and lessons learned from managing their time working on a complex project in a team.

## Resources

- 🐙 [Training Kit GitHub Repo](https://github.com/LambdaSchool/labs-curriculum)
- 🐙 [Labs Student Guide](https://www.notion.so/lambdaschool/Labs-25-Student-Guide-7be23f8048ca4d2eae69a06f4613f67a)

## Schedule

Here’s an overview of our guided project schedule today:

![GitHub GP schedule](https://tk-assets.lambdaschool.com/b72be6bc-5a32-4038-a022-637b29245564_ScreenShot2020-07-31at4.25.15PM.png)

## Purpose

Useful as it is for the individual, a version control system becomes even more essential for software development on a team.

On a team, your level of professionalism in a GitHub workflow (something you’re all quite familiar with by now) can impact your teammates efficiency and the forward momentum of your product’s development. It’s not just you playing in your sandbox anymore – sloppy process has consequences.

## Lesson

### _I Do_

#### Why version control is important

- Your instructor describes the importance of version control in working with a team.

### _We Do_

#### GitHub workflow walkthrough

- Using an example repository, your instructor creates a new branch, edits a file, and pushes to the new branch – engaging with student participation throughout and soliciting suggestions for next steps.

#### Writing a good pull request

## Schedule

Here’s an overview of our guided project schedule today.

![Engineering Critique GP schedule](https://tk-assets.lambdaschool.com/2d9ff682-24ad-4d9f-98e6-51a023b2ac65_ScreenShot2020-08-18at7.56.09PM.png)

## Purpose

Everything at Lambda is engineered to prepare you for your future job. Framing your learning in the context of its application on the job or in a hiring manager interview should serve as a vital reminder of your trajectory.

Recontextualizing your user architecture breakdown as an exercise in interview prep serves as an excellent example of how we want you to reimagine the real-world relevance of all the work you do here.

## Lesson

### _I Do_

#### Review takeaways from yesterday’s guided project

- Your instructor takes a few minutes to review the key points and takeaways from our previous guided project on engineering.

### _We Do_

#### Hiring manager questions

- Your instructor guides class participation via Slack in assembling a number of questions hiring managers could ask about the thinking and technical decision-making behind your architecture breakdown.

#### Speaking about your process

- Your instructor picks three teams and conducts a review of their architecture documents for the class, asking questions like:
  - “Describe a technical choice you made.”
  - “Given the decision you made, what do you feel are some of the risks?”
  - “What challenges do you foresee with the architecture your team selected?”
- Your instructor may incorporate some student-curated questions as well, offering tips and feedback on responding to these sorts of questions.

### _You Do_

#### Going over the inquiry

- Your instructor discusses the inquiry questions and what you should focus on in the afternoon.

## After Class

Take a few minutes to review the principles you’ve learned. What questions do you still have? Remember, your instructor, TL, and Labs Support Hours are here to help. Don’t hesitate to reach out.

#### Objectives:

## [Module Inquiry 2](../module/recedcXwfMEbKReKU)

## Questions

1.  What technical choices did you make today?
2.  Pick two technical choices you’re happy with. What was your thought process as you made those choices? What did you consider and what did you decide against?
    - Take a moment to think about the advantages in choosing the route that you did.
    - Now take a moment to consider the disadvantages.
3.  In one or two sentences, summarize why you ultimately made the choice you did.
4.  Extracting useful conclusions from your process:
    - According to your understanding, what makes a good technical choice?

#### Objectives:

## [Sprint Challenge](../module/recZL7TFXJI2b935w)

## Objectives

- Student can articulate breaking down a release into individual tasks.
- Student can accurately defend scope or timeline of an individual task
- Students will be able to articulate tradeoffs for architectural and design decisions

## Prompt 1 - Communicating Process

Hiring managers don’t just want to see what you built, they want to see the reasoning behind it. Here are some questions surveyed hiring managers said they would ask about a project:

- “How did you decide what to build?”
- “Why is this feature important?”
- “Was this a good choice? What would you do differently if you had to do it over again?”

We took these questions and cooked them into your labs experience. Please answer the following questions as you would in an interview. Remember, hiring managers care about the **process** and the **why** of building something even more than the what.

1.  Describe your **process** of breaking a release into user stories.
2.  Choose a user story. Describe your **reasoning** as you broke down that particular user story into individual tasks.
3.  How long do you think the above user story will take to complete? Explain your reasoning.

## Prompt 2 - Communicating Technical Decisions

On the job, you’ll be making technical decisions every day. Hiring managers want to see how you make a choice and how you communicate your decisions. Here are some examples of questions they might ask about one of your projects in an interview:

- “What kind of database did you choose and why?”
- “Why did you use X to do Y?”

These sorts of questions inform your entire labs experience. You made a few technical decisions this week. We want to see how you would communicate them in an interview.

1.  Describe a technical decision you made. How did you make that decision?
2.  What are some of the risks given the decision you made?
3.  What challenges do you foresee in using the architecture your team selected?

## Prompt 3 - Professional Development

### [Power Statements](<https://learn.lambdaschool.com/cr/module/recQUR9bWxvLBJknr%5D(https://learn.lambdaschool.com/cr/module/recQUR9bWxvLBJknr)>)

This lesson we reinforced how to turn your responsibilities and tasks into power statements. To practice, write a few power statements you intend to use in your LinkedIn profile. Before writing those statements, ensure your LinkedIn has all the following content checked off.

## Personal and Contact Information:

- First and last name are added to profile
- Created a [shortened, unique](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/87/customizing-your-public-profile-url?lang=en) LinkedIn URL
- Profile picture is clear, shows my face (not a selfie), and is in front of a professional background
- Listed title, `i.e. iOS Developer`, below name with any keyword associations included. **For example: “Data Scientist, with a passion for data visualizations and open-source code”**
  - Title **does not** pull from my current position (this is a LinkedIn default, must manually change), unless that position is relevant to the tech industry

## About Section

- Wrote a minimum of 3 sentences to describe my technical skills, background, interests, and passions. (Also feel free to include key professional accomplishments.)

## Experience Section

- Listed all, or at least the last 3-5 years of previous professional roles
- Included 2-4 power statements for each experience listed (okay to copy and paste from resume)
  - Power statements for each experience [are bulleted](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/update-how-add-bullet-points-your-linkedin-profile-erin-dore-miller/), not in paragraph form.
  - Listed responsibilities in bullet point format (I **did not** leave in paragraph format). If you use Windows, hold down the ALT key and type 0149 on the keypad. Release the ALT key and the bullet point will appear. On a Mac, press Opt + 8 on the keyboard.
  - Started each bullet point with [an action verb](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wZkDPBWtQZDGGdvStD61iRx_jOWVlIyyQl9UOYHtZgA/edit?usp=sharing) and **did not** re-use phrases such as: `Assisted with...` `Worked on...` `Helped with...` (`Solely responsible for...`)
  - Described past projects in past tense and current projects in present tense
  - Did not use pronouns such as: I, we, they, you, me, us

## Education

- Listed all education and relevant certifications: including name of the institution, degree type, and date the degree was received or will be received `i.e. May 2020` or `Expected July 2025`
  - I **did** link to Lambda School properly (Lambda logo saved)

## Skills

- **Listed** all technical skills, methodologies, and platforms with strongest skills [pinned at the top of the list](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/35265/display-order-of-skill-endorsements?lang=en)

With all the above checked off, go to LinkedIn’s “Accomplishments” section to add a project. Articulating the tasks or project work you’re doing publicly on a platform like LinkedIn can help you gain visibility! LinkedIn is designed to produce better results, recommendations, and engagement for users who have thorough profiles and who upload content. If you haven’t done so already, write a few power statements as well as a project description to populate those content fields and describe your project on LinkedIn.

This is also a good time to add your fellow labs teammates as connections so that you can add them as “creators” on the project.

Here’s the checklist you’ll want to complete for projects:

## Projects (Under “Accomplishments”)

- **Listed** title for Labs projects
- **Included one sentence** to describe what the project does
  - I **did not** use the phrase `This project was...` or `This project is...` in description
  - I **did not** use more than one sentence to describe the project
- **Listed** the tech stack used for each project (see below for example)
- **Listed 2-3 power statement bullets** highlighting my responsibilities on project
- **Did not** use the words “capstone” “Lambda Labs” or “School” project
