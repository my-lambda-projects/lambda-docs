                <h5>Overview</h5>
                <p>
                  Nothing can bring about that panicky feeling like suddenly
                  getting stuck during an interviewer. Itâs as bad as freezing
                  from stage fright when you are supposed to be performing in
                  front of a live audience.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Youâd expect to get stuck in a normal situation, and youâd
                  probably go to Google or StackOverflow to search for help.
                  However, in an interview, thatâs not possible. So, what do you
                  do?
                </p>
                <p>
                  The following are some simple tips and suggestions to make
                  sure you can always get unstuck during an interview.
                </p>

                <h3 id="remember-you-should-get-stuck">
                  Remember, You Should Get Stuck
                </h3>
                <p>
                  Interviewers choose problems hard enough that they expect to
                  see you get stuck. They want to know how you react and your
                  problem-solving process when you get stuck on an issue.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Contrary to what youâd think, if you quickly solve the problem
                  with no issues whatsoever, the interviewer may assume youâd
                  already seen the problem and feel like they werenât able to
                  assess your problem-solving abilities honestly.

                  If you get stuck (as youâd expect) and can problem-solve your
                  way out of getting stuck, this can lead to a positive
                  evaluation and getting hired.

                <h3 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h3>
                <p>
                  One of the best ways to get started is to think of the
                  simplest possible version of the problem and solve it for
                  that. Then, slowly introduce complexity by changing the input
                  to more challenging and more problematic cases.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Use a simple input and draw out how you would solve the
                  challenge by hand with pictures and pseudocode. Now, try to
                  generalize the process that you used to solve this simple case
                  into actual code. Look for patterns that you used in your
                  process.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Even if you know that your initial solution is not the most
                  efficient, you can mention that you want to get a working
                  solution first and optimize afterward. It is much easier to
                  optimize an existing, working solution than trying to optimize
                  the ideas that are still just floating around in your ahead.
                  Also, by getting a solution down and then working to optimize
                  it, it is easier for the interviewer to follow and see your
                  entire process.
                </p>
                <h3 id="optimizing-your-initial-solution">
                  Optimizing Your Initial Solution
                </h3>
                <p>
                  Always look for optimization hints in the problem description
                  itself. For example, if the problem description mentions that
                  an array is <em>sorted,</em> then one likely optimization is
                  to use binary search for lookups in that list.
                </p>
                <p>
                  You should always consider if there is a data structure that
                  you can use to optimize your initial solution. Does your
                  solution have slow lookups? Why not utilize a hash table which
                  has fast lookup operations? Always look at the problem
                  description and see if there is a specific data structure that
                  stands out to work well with the problem.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Look for cases where youâre iterating through the same
                  sequence multiple times. Can you figure out a way to iterate
                  through the sequence only once? Can you utilize a different
                  data structure that will allow you to minimize your
                  iterations?
                </p>
                <p>
                  Try to figure out, conceptually, what the best possible space
                  and runtime complexities are and talk through your reasoning
                  out loud. Then, your interviewer can see your understanding of
                  the problem. Even if you canât make it as efficient as
                  possible during the interview, they will know that you can
                  analyze a problem and figure out what a good goal for space
                  and time complexity are.
                </p>
                <h3 id="last-resort">Last Resort</h3>
                <p>
                  If you are feeling stuck and cannot figure out a way to get
                  moving again, you should always talk out loud about what you
                  currently know and what your goal for the problem is. If you
                  can articulate <em>why</em> you are stuck and precisely what
                  you are stuck with, your interviewer can provide you a good
                  hint to help you get moving again. Remember, this isnât
                  necessarily a bad thing. Your ability to comfortably
                  articulate why you are stuck on a specific problem is a plus
                  for the interview.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Also, make sure to pay attention to everything your
                  interviewer is saying. They are likely trying to give you
                  hints by even subtle questions they are asking or things they
                  are pointing out in your code. Donât ignore their questions or
                  comments to drive ahead with your current plan.

                <h5>Overview</h5>
                <p>
                  First, letâs start by getting one thing clear,
                  <strong><em>you are NOT an imposter</em></strong
                  >. If youâve made it this far in your journey at Lambda, you
                  know A LOT, and have grown tremendously. Despite that fact, it
                  is not uncommon to still <strong><em>feel</em></strong> like
                  an imposter. Letâs go over some strategies for overcoming
                  these feelings, especially when they crop up during an
                  interview or while preparing for an interview.

                  Computer Science and Data Science are massive fields. You
                  <em>could</em> spend your entire adult life studying one small
                  sliver of one of those fields. So, here you are, with maybe
                  only six months of programming experience under your belt.
                  Every new thing you learn only seems to uncover all these
                  other tangential things you <em>donât</em> know. The more you
                  discover your little section of the universe, the more you
                  realize how <strong><em>big</em></strong> the universe is.

                  In many ways, this gets worse over time, not better. The more
                  advanced your knowledge gets, the things you donât know tend
                  to get harder and harder to learn. So, instead of learning
                  some new topic in a week or an evening, you can expect it
                  might take months or years to become comfortable with it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The critical thing to recognize is that you will always feel
                  this way to a degree. Because, even as you grow in your career
                  and learn more and more, you will still be aware of all there
                  is to know that you currently donât. Donât let this fact trick
                  you into feeling like an imposter. You are not an imposter.
                  You know things and have valuable skills and assets, and
                  employers are ready and willing to pay you for them.

                <p>
                  One of the worst tricks we play on ourselves is convincing
                  ourselves that everyone else already knows what we know. So,
                  we look out at the world and our colleagues and classmates and
                  assume that we know the <em>easy stuff.</em> All of the stuff
                  that they know that we donât is the <em>real, hard stuff</em
                  ><strong>.</strong> This is not true at all.

                  In reality, there is a chunk of things that you know that is
                  unique to you among a group of colleagues or teammates.
                  Additionally, each of your teammates has a piece of knowledge
                  that is unique to them. There is some overlap between each of
                  you where you have some shared understanding among each other.

                  So, donât forget, even as a junior engineer that is joining a
                  new team. You have skills and knowledge that members of your
                  team do not have. And vice versa. This is the normal state of
                  affairs, and itâs okay that your colleagues and teammates know
                  things that you donât.

                <h3 id="getting-your-focus-right">Getting Your Focus Right</h3>
                <p>
                  So, as you prepare for an interview, you have to make sure to
                  get your mind right. Get your area of focus right. Throughout
                  your time at Lambda, you are always focused on the
                  ever-expanding body of knowledge that you donât know or that
                  you could know. Additionally, you are growing a network of
                  friends and colleagues, and you see all of the things that
                  they know that you donât.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But you have to remember that you will never know everything
                  that you could know. You will never know everything that your
                  interviewer knows or that your future colleagues and teammates
                  know. That is perfectly fine, okay, and normal. You are just
                  like everyone else; there is a whole host of things you donât
                  know.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This fact should make you feel a <em>part of</em> not
                  <em>apart from</em>. You belong in tech. You can and will get
                  a job in tech. You will keep learning, and yet you will still
                  have things you do not know.

                <p>
                  Spend 5-10 minutes making a list of the things you know and
                  all of the skills youâve acquired over the years. Go firm on
                  this. I mean, think of <em>all the things</em> you know and
                  all the skills you have. After you are done, take a moment to
                  reflect on that list. Please recognize that you bring a lot to
                  the table and remember that it is normal to have lots of gaps
                  in your knowledge and things you donât know. You will likely
                  need to remind yourself of this often, especially as you go
                  into the interviewing process.

                      and all of the skills youâve acquired over the years. Go
                      firm on this. I mean, think of <em>all the things</em> you
                      know and all the skills you have. After you are done, take
                      a moment to reflect on that list. Please recognize that
                      you bring a lot to the table and remember that it is
                      normal to have lots of gaps in your knowledge and things
                      you donât know. You will likely need to remind yourself of
                      this often, especially as you go into the interviewing
                      process.
