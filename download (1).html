                <p>
                  Slack is an online communication tool used widely in the tech
                  industry. For Lambda School, it is the most important and
                  frequent way we communicate with students. If youâve never
                  used Slack before, get to know it well. Nearly every company
                  in Silicon Valley uses it, and itâs rapidly becoming a point
                  of competence across software engineering teams.
                </p>
                <h5>Overview</h5>
                <p>
                  Slack is a collaboration hub where you will communicate with
                  everyone at Lambda School. Slack is used because of the
                  following benefits and features not provided by an email
                  system;
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Organized conversations</li>
                  <li>Searchable history</li>
                  <li>
                    Apps and integrations Slack can be used in a browser, as a
                    desktop app, and as a mobile app. It is vitally important
                    that you are on Slack every school day at Lambda.

                    <p>
                      You will be placed in a Slack channel with the other
                      students in your program. The instructor will interact
                      with you in this Slack channel. They will post lecture
                      links to their Zoom rooms, answer questions and post
                      additional resources.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Once youâve filled out your confirmation form, you will be
                      added to the student Slack workspace and assigned to a few
                      main channels depending on your class and group.

                        a smaller group with your Project Manager. For example,
                        if your Project Manager is Alicia Jackson, that Slack
                        channel might be named #WEB18_aj.</em

                <p>
                  When setting your Slack avatar, use a professional profile
                  photo, just as you would for a job. Also, use your first and
                  last name on your profile.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Your course channel (For Example #WEB18) channel is the first
                  place you should post if you are confused or stuck. A PM or
                  Instructor will jump in and help you work through the
                  challenge at hand.

                  When it is time for a lecture, a Zoom link will be posted in
                  your class channel with the @channel tag, which should send
                  you both desktop and push notifications. Make sure to follow
                  the schedule and be on time for those lectures, as your class
                  may not wait for you.

                  Use a thread if your comments apply to a certain Slack message
                  to make it easier to follow conversations. A menu will pop-up
                  to the top right when you hover over a message. Choose the
                  comment bubble to thread your replies.

                <p>
                  Typing a message in Slack that includes â@hereâ or â@channelâ
                  notifies everyone in that channel. This sends an alert to
                  their desktop, or, in many cases, their personal cellphones.
                  As such, please use â@hereâ and â@channelâ sparingly in your
                  cohort or local channels, and not in general channels. Thanks
                  for helping us keep Slack usable!

                  Tips for Being a Professional in a Zoom Meeting
                </h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    If you are not speaking set your microphone to mute. But, be
                    sure to toggle it on when it is your time to speak.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    When your microphone is on be aware of distracting noises.
                    If using an onboard microphone on a laptop using your
                    keyboard will be very loud to other Zoom participants.
                    Little things like cell phone buzzers, the noise of your
                    microphone rubbing on your shirt collar or a squeaky office
                    chair can be enough to distract your audience.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Shut out your most distracting housemates. If you have a
                    child, a dog, a cat, a guinea pig, or any other animal that
                    can get loud or âneedyâ at times, theyâre probably going to
                    want to be involved in your conversations as soon as they
                    hear you talking to the cool people on the other side of the
                    monitor. Itâs best to just leave them out of the room while
                    the meetingâs going on.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Be camera ready. If possible before the meeting have a look
                    at yourself on webcam. You might notice that the webcam is
                    pointed at your forehead, your lighting makes it difficult
                    to see you or you have something distracting in your
                    background. If your lighting is behind you, people will only
                    see a silhouette. Make sure that any light coming towards
                    your face is stronger than the light behind you. Wear a nice
                    shirt. From your Mac or PC, just click âSettingsâ on your
                    Zoom client, and then âVideoâ to see what you look like
                    before you join the meeting.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Thereâs a lot to be said about video meeting etiquette
                    regarding eating and drinking. If youâre grabbing a cup of
                    tea or some bottled water, thatâs acceptable, or at least
                    more acceptable than slurping spaghetti during your meeting.
                    Along the same lines, it is not professional to be smoking
                    or vaping during a video meeting.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Before you share your screen, it would be wise to eliminate
                    any possible occasion for distraction during the screen
                    sharing session. This means closing social networks,
                    messaging applications, and anything that pops up or flashes
                    while youâre trying to present something.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Use a webcam and allow your classmates to see you on video.
                    Video conferencing is more engaging and allows you to make
                    virtual eye contact with your classmates, project managers
                    and instructors. Humans process visual information far
                    faster than text or audio, so it will also increase your
                    ability to communicate and learn.

                <p>
                  The same credentials you used to access your training kit can

                </p>
                <p>
                  The dashboard is where you as a student can find feedback from
                  the team leader (TL) who reviewed your work. In the top header
                  youâll see your name, section and TL. You will see the sprint
                  challenges that you have completed, the titles, how many
                  attempts it took to pass the sprint and whether it was passed
                  or not. If you need to take another try at a sprint challenge
                  the green box will be red and have the word âresubmitâ shown
                  in the box. If you miss submitting a sprint the red box will
                  read âmissingâ.

                  This dashboard shows you the feedback from your TL on your

                  FrontDesk is your way of contacting Lambda School staff with
                  non-classwork related enquiries. This should be your main

                <p>
                  Frontdesk is accessed through Slack by starting a direct

                  a screen for you to enter a title and description of the issue

                  will reply to your request in Slack.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Frontdesk in meant only for submitting feedback and support
                  requests. If you have classwork related questions go ahead and
                  contact your team lead or your class help channel. When asking
                  a question try to give as much detail as possible. Remember to
                  only reply to the threaded messages on your Ticket in the
                  FrontDesk Slack App, that way you can refer to the answers
                  given to you if you forget or have followup questions. Even if
                  you are frustrated, be sure to be professional in all of your
                  interactions with Lambda staff.

                  School as the main calendar. You will receive an invite to the
                  Google Calendar for your track. Lambda School operates on
                  California time (Pacific Standard Time and Pacific Daylight
                  Savings Time) and takes U.S. holidays. Check the Google
                  Calendar on a regular basis to be sure you are in attendance
                  every day that there is class.

                  The income share agreement allows Lambda School to provide an
                  education that usually costs tens of thousands of dollars
                  upfront for no upfront cost. The US and UK/EU ISA agreements
                  have different requirements, so be sure to read the section
                  pertaining to your location.

                  Students can elect to pay tuition upfront. Or, instead of
                  paying tuition upfront, many Lambda School Students choose to
                  sign an Income Share Agreement (ISA). ISAs allow us to provide
                  an education that usually costs tens of thousands of dollars
                  upfront for no upfront cost.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Paying tuition upfront for any Lambda track will cost $30,000.
                  Instead of paying tuition upfront, many Lambda School students
                  choose to sign an Income Share Agreement (ISA). Students canât
                  switch from an Income Share Agreement (ISA) to upfront payment
                  after class begins. If you do not qualify for an ISA due to
                  citizenship or location, then paying upfront tuition may be
                  your only option for attending Lambda School.

                <h4 id="what-is-an-isa">What is an ISA?</h4>
                <p>
                  Income Share Agreements are not a form of debt, nor are they a
                  loan. There is no interest or fees charged on a Lambda ISA
                  agreement. An ISA is a legally binding agreement representing
                  a responsibility to pay Lambda School a portion of future
                  income. The use of an ISA aligns Lambda School values with
                  your best interests. If you donât find a well-paying job, you
                  donât have to pay.
                </p>
                <h4 id="how-much-do-you-pay-with-the-isa">
                  How much do you pay with the ISA?
                </h4>
                <p>
                  Under Lambda Schoolâs Income Share Agreement, students agree
                  to pay 17% of their post-Lambda School gross income with 24
                  monthly payments, but only when they are making more than
                  $4,167 per month (that is, $50,000 per year). For example, if
                  a student gets a job paying $60,000/year, theyâre earning
                  $5,000 per month. 17% of $5,000 is $850, so they pay $850 per
                  month under their ISA.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As long as a Student is earning above the minimum income
                  threshold (the $4,167), and is working in a qualified industry
                  or position, they will make monthly payments of 17% of their
                  income for 24 months. If a Studentâs income ever drops below
                  $4,166 per month, they wonât make a payment in that month. Our
                  ISA is also capped at a maximum of $30k. Students will never
                  pay more than $30k under any circumstances. If a student
                  reaches the $30k maximum payment amount prior to the 24-month
                  terms, their ISA will be considered complete.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Your ISA payments are based on your income so your total cost
                  can be between $0 and $30,000.
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    If your income never reaches the $4,167 monthly threshold,
                    you will be in deferment. You have 60 months of deferment
                    and if you do not have qualifying pay or position during
                    that time you will end up paying $0 for your education.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Important note: there are cases where, because payments
                    stopped and started due to deferment, the total 60 months of
                    deferment could be more than 5 calendar years from the date
                    the Student completes Lambda School.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If youâre making good money (congratulations!), you could
                    pay up to the $30,000 cap.
                  </li>
                  <li>Youâll never pay more than $30,000.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  Anything you pay is spread out over 24 separate monthly
                  payments.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The 17% is a percentage of a Studentâs gross income, i.e.
                  before taxes.

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    If you decide to withdraw in the first 4 sprints, your
                    tuition or any installment payments will be returned in
                    full. Your ISA will be canceled.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    After completion of 4 sprints, you become responsible for
                    40% of the tuition.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Each week thereafter you become responsible for another 10%
                    of the tuition
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    After 10 weeks, you are responsible for tuition in full.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  If pro-ration occurs, its made on the ISA Cap, not the Income
                  Share percentage. In other words, if you withdraw early and
                  are 50% vested, you would still owe the 17% for 24 months, but
                  the cap would be reduced to $15k from the original $30k.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Students who withdraw or are withdrawn will have their income
                  share agreements prorated as described above in our refund

                  Lambda School currently utilizes a service provider called

                  handles all of the collecting, reporting, and other
                  administration related to our ISAs.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Income Share Agreement requires Students to do a few
                  things, including (but not limited to):â
                </p>
                <p>â¢ Reporting their monthly income</p>
                <p>â¢ Reporting their job status</p>
                <p>â¢ Submitting their tax returnsâ</p>
                <p>
                  Meratas will contact students to remind them to report their
                  income, but itâs important to understand that the ISA contract
                  obligates students to self-report their income and job status.
                </p>
                <p>
                  ISA payments are collected on the 1st of the month, and
                  Meratas gives a 28-day starting grace period to Lambda
                  Students. For example, if you start a job on August 15th, the
                  28-day grace period would bump you past the September 1st
                  payment. Your 1st payment would then be the next month,
                  October 1st.

                <p>
                  If your income is less than $4167 a month, your account will
                  be placed in deferment status. You will not be required to
                  make payments. You have 60 months of deferment, then your ISA
                  will end and require no additional payments. Your payment term
                  will be extended for every month your income is below the
                  threshold. This could potentially extend your agreement up to
                  83 months if you are coming in and out of deferment.

                  an education that usually costs tens of thousands of dollars
                  upfront for no upfront cost. Tuition can be paid before
                  classes begin for any Lambda track and the cost is Â£25,000 or
                  â¬27,500. Instead of paying tuition upfront, many Lambda School
                  students choose to sign an Income Share Agreement (ISA).
                  Students canât switch from an ISA to upfront payment during
                  class. By day 1 of class you must have either a signed ISA or
                  paid tuition.

                <h4 id="what-is-an-isa-agreement">What is an ISA Agreement?</h4>
                <p>
                  An income share agreement is not a loan. There is no interest
                  or fees charged to the student in relation to the ISA. It is
                  an obligation to make payments based on your future earned
                  income. It does not give Lambda School any rights to dictate
                  your employer, career choices or location in the future.
                </p>
                <h4 id="how-much-do-you-pay-with-the-isa-1">
                  How much do you pay with the ISA?
                </h4>
                <p>
                  Under our ISA you agree to pay 10% of your pre-tax income with
                  48 monthly payments, but only when youâre making more than
                  Â£2000 or â¬2291 per month (that is, Â£25,000 or â¬27,500 per
                  year).
                </p>
                <p>
                  For example, if you get a job paying Â£30,000 a year, youâre
                  earning Â£2,500 per month. 10% of Â£2,500 is Â£250, so you pay
                  Â£250 that month for your ISA.
                </p>
                <p>
                  You make 10% payments on your income every month until youâve
                  made 48 monthly payments. If your income ever drops below
                  Â£2,000 or â¬2,291 per month you donât make a payment that
                  month. Our ISA is also capped at a maximum of Â£25,000 or
                  â¬27,500. Youâll never pay more than Â£25,000 or â¬27,500 under
                  any circumstances.
                </p>

                  Your ISA payments are based on your income so your total cost

                <p>
                  If your income is less than Â£2,000 or â¬2,291 a month, your
                  account will be placed in deferment status. Your payment term
                  will be extended for every month your income is below the
                  threshold. You have 48 months of deferment. Important note:
                  there are cases where, because payments stopped and started
                  due to deferment, the total 48 months of deferment could be
                  more than 4 calendar years from the date the Student completes
                  Lambda School.

                  Any income earned in a job counts whether it is as an
                  employee, contractor, self-employed, temporary or second job.
                  You are required to report to EdAid your monthly earned income
                  by providing pay stubs, a letter from your employer, a
                  self-employment contract, a consulting agreement or other
                  verifiable source. EdAid will recalculate your monthly
                  payments based on the information provided. Your repayment of
                  the ISA allows Lambda School to continue to serve future

                  ISA payments are collected the first full month after your

                  training kit. Then you will spend the first 15 minutes of
                  class on lecture days doing the same. This allows you to have
                  a âfirst passâ at the content and allows you to move right
                  into the guided project. This also allows you to be a better
                  prepared student and ask better questions and get more out of

                  through a preset project while explaining what they are doing
                  along the way. Remember that this is the âWe Doâ part of the
                  IWY loop, so you should be joining in as much as possible.
                  Your instructor will be asking lots of questions and asking

                  Once the guided project is over, you will move into an

                  content of the lecture/guided project demo on your own to a
                  project with detailed guidelines. You will work on this during

                <p>
                  In a standard school grading system a percentage is calculated
                  and you earn a letter grade. There are some challenges with
                  this system that makes it ineffective when training a
                  technical employee. In one scenario you have a straight âAâ
                  student who just naturally gets the material and they meet the
                  outcomes but arenât pushed or motivated to work up to their
                  own potential. Then you have a âCâ student who is only meeting
                  about 70% of the outcomes but just keeps continuing on to half
                  understand material in the next topic. Finally, youâve got a
                  student that is doing the bare minimum and getting the 59.5%
                  required to not have to redo the class. They are getting some
                  credit for showing up and probably not meeting many of the
                  outcomes. All these students graduate with the same high
                  school diploma.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This system doesnât work in the real world. An employer wants
                  to know that you can do the tasks given to you at near 100%
                  accuracy. They are looking for a motivated individual that
                  will go beyond the bare minimum requirements. The employer
                  wants to be able to train you quickly on new technologies, so
                  your ability to learn matters. Finally, they want you to be
                  able to take critical feedback and use it to improve. If
                  youâve always been the straight âAâ student, critical feedback
                  can be crushing and demoralizing.

                  This means that you did not meet at least one of the outcome
                  expectations of the project. You may have done very well on
                  other outcomes. If you receive a â1â it means you get an

                  those of you use to earning âAâsâ, this is not equivalent.
                  This is for stretch goals that have been met because you find

                <p>
                  The focus on outcomes creates a clear expectation of what
                  needs to be accomplished by the end of the lesson. Students
                  will understand what is expected of them and instructors will
                  know what they need to teach during the course. Clarity is
                  important in strategic programs like Lambda school where there
                  are many teams working across a track. Each team member has a
                  clear understanding of what needs to be accomplished in each
                  sprint. Those designing and planning the curriculum are
                  expected to work backwards once an outcome has been decided
                  upon; they must determine what knowledge and skills will be
                  required to reach the outcome.

                <p>
                  With a clear sense of what needs to be accomplished,
                  instructors will be able to structure their lessons around the
                  studentâs needs. Instructors are free to teach their students
                  using any method. Instructors will also be able to recognize
                  diversity among students by using various teaching and
                  assessment techniques during their class. Outcomes based
                  assessment is a student-centered learning model. Instructors
                  guide and help the students understand the material in any way

                <p>
                  The articulated outcomes allow Lambda school to assess the
                  studentâs achievements rapidly, leading to increased amounts
                  of feedback to students. These outcomes also work for school
                  to work transitions. A potential employer can find what
                  outcomes a Lambda school student has achieved. They can then
                  determine if the potential employee has the skills necessary
                  for the job. At Lambda school the entire focus is on meeting
                  employers expectations for educational outcomes.

                <h4 id="involvement">Involvement</h4>
                <p>
                  Student involvement in the classroom is a key part of outcomes
                  based assessment. Students are expected to do their own
                  learning, so that they gain a full understanding of the
                  material. Increased student involvement allows students to
                  feel responsible for their own learning, and they should learn
                  more through this individual learning. Employer partners are
                  asked to give input to Lambda School to uphold the standards
                  of education and to ensure that students will be prepared for
                  employment after school.

                  The Lambda School day is going to differ from any school day
                  you have participated in before. Every day you will have
                  measurable objectives to meet. Lambda School uses the
                  instructional method - I do, We do, You do. So you get the
                  support upfront that you need to learn. But, by the afternoon
                  you are working on a project with real-world applications.

                <h5>Overview</h5>
                <h3 id="general-track-schedule">General Track Schedule</h3>
                <p>
                  The Lambda school tracks follow a specific curriculum with the
                  framework of I do, You do, We do. All courses have a universal
                  schedule with four units of focus track, eight sprints of
                  Labs, two units of track-specific curriculum, and then Lambda
                  X. Each unit consists of four sprints with the last sprint
                  being a Project/Build Week.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A sprint is a timeboxed iteration of a continuous development
                  cycle. Within a Sprint, the team completes a planned amount of
                  work to prepare for a review. The term Sprint comes from the
                  Scrum Agile method but the basic idea of Kanban continuous
                  delivery is also in the essence of Sprint Scrum. At Lambda a
                  sprint is one week for a full-time cohort and two weeks for
                  part-time.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There are four units in the Core Curriculum which correspond
                  with 4 build weeks.<br />
                  Labs consist of eight sprints which give you time to polish
                  your project with your team and make it a central portfolio
                  piece. Lambda X consists of eight sprints per iteration. This
                  time allows students to continue polishing their portfolio
                  pieces. This ensures they are ready to move on to employment.

                <p>
                  This is your chance to get the intellectual juices flowing and
                  provide a structure for the rest of your day. You will look
                  over the material in the training kit, watch any videos shown
                  in the pre-work and prepare for the guided project. In some
                  tracks, you will do a code challenge and in Data Science you
                  may do a âwalkie talkieâ where you practice explaining data.

                  For your guided project you will follow a link to Zoom and
                  meet your instructor in a live session. For two hours your
                  instructor will take you step by step through a project. You
                  will be able to see their computer screen and exactly what
                  code they are typing in. Youâll be able to interact through
                  chat or microphone with your instructor. This is the âI do and

                  code, learn more, troubleshoot the code, research answers, ask
                  for help, and finish writing the code if youâre in
                  development. Replace âcodeâ with âanalyze the dataâ for DS and
                  âdesignâ for UX.

                <p>3:45 pm - 4:15 pm Project Wrap and Report</p>
                <p>
                  It is time to submit the project you have been working on. You
                  will reflect on your day and fill out your daily retrospective
                  form.

                  Your team lead will meet with you 1:1 to go over your Sprint
                  Challenge and assess how you did. This is also time to get
                  help with any concepts you didnât comprehend during the past

                  The Lambda school assessment process will state when you have
                  achieved mastery of each goal and act as a signal for when you
                  need extra support. Lambda is based on objective mastery and
                  not grades. Future employers want you to know how to perform

                  For this reason, regular assessment is a cornerstone of our

                <p>
                  You will meet with your assigned Team Lead daily for 10
                  minutes. Besides providing you with a verbal code review, your
                  TL will work with you to assess your understanding of the
                  current module. Your TL will indicate if you need extra
                  support to master the objectives. If indicated by your TL, you
                  will be required to attend two hours of TL Hour to target the
                  objectives you need more time to understand.

                  Following the completion of your sprint challenge, you will
                  meet with your Team Lead to discuss your performance. The Team
                  Lead will submit a review of your Sprint Challenge as well as
                  verification of performance in the following areas;
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Technical skills</li>

                  Students will attend Targeted Support hours, also repeating
                  units as needed. Every student stays within the same sprint
                  group with instructor-led guided projects. Support Hours and
                  content repetition are available during the Core Track
                  Curriculum, Labs, and during the Additional Track Curriculum
                </p>
                <p>
                  Accumulation of two sprint challenges rated at a 1 will show
                  if you need to repeat the unit.

                <p>
                  During your time in Labs, youâll work as a team to build
                  larger-scale portfolio projects. Your adherence to the
                  designed structure is crucial to your success and the success
                  of your team.
                </p>
                <p>We will assess your participation in Labs in three areas:</p>

                  Your project sometimes needs extra time to be at the level
                  expected. Assessment of your progress and ability to
                  collaborate as a team may result in the need to repeat a unit.

                <p>
                  To receive a badge and move into Lambda X, students will have
                  to pass a final assessment. The exact process includes more
                  details, but here are a few highlights:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Summative formal technical assessment</li>

                <h4 id="lambda-endorsement">Lambda Endorsement</h4>
                <p>
                  An endorsement is synonymous with graduation at Lambda School.
                  There are many checkpoints for students to keep them on track
                  towards full endorsement; rather than having one final
                  endorsement checkbox, there will be milestones in each unit.
                  Students know how theyâre tracking towards full endorsement.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There are technical, career and teamwork expectations to meet
                  endorsement requirements.
